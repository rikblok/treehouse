  {"id":"abelsonBlown2008","abstract":"“If you want to understand the future before it happens, you’ll love this book. If you want to change the future before it happens to you, this book is required reading.” –Reed Hundt, former Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission    “There is no simpler or clearer statement of the radical change that digital technologies will bring, nor any book that better prepares one for thinking about the next steps.” –Lawrence  Lessig, Stanford Law School and Author of Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace    “Blown to Bits will blow you away. In highly accessible and always fun prose, it explores all the nooks and crannies of the digital universe, exploring not only how this exploding space works but also what it means.” –Debora Spar, President of Barnard College, Author of Ruling the Waves and The Baby Business    “This is a wonderful book–probably the best since Hal Varian and Carl Schultz wrote Digital Rules. The authors are engineers, not economists. The result is a long, friendly talk with the genie, out of the lamp, and willing to help you avoid making the traditional mistake with that all-important third wish.” –David Warsh, Author of Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations    “Blown to Bits is one of the clearest expositions I’ve seen of the social and political issues arising from the Internet. Its remarkably clear explanations of how the Net actually works lets the hot air out of some seemingly endless debates. You’ve made explaining this stuff look easy. Congratulations!” –David Weinberger, Coauthor of The Cluetrain Manifesto and Author of Everything Is Miscellaneous: The Power of the New Digital Disorder.   “Blown to Bits is a timely, important, and very readable take on how information is produced and consumed today, and more important, on the approaching sea change in the way that we as a society deal with the consequences.” –Craig Silverstein, Director of Technology, Google, Inc.   “This book gives an overview of the kinds of issues confronting society as we become increasingly dependent on the Internet and the World Wide Web. Every informed citizen should read this book and then form their own opinion on these and related issues. And after reading this book you will rethink how (and even whether) you use the Web to form your opinions…” –James S. Miller, Senior Director for Technology Policy and Strategy, Microsoft Corporation   “Most writing about the digital world comes from techies writing about technical matter for other techies or from pundits whose turn of phrase greatly exceeds their technical knowledge. In Blown to Bits, experts in computer science address authoritatively the practical issues in which we all have keen interest.” –Howard Gardner, Hobbs Professor of Cognition and Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Author of Multiple Intelligences and Changing Minds      “Regardless of your experience with computers, Blown to Bits provides a uniquely entertaining and informative perspective from the computing industry’s greatest minds. A fascinating, insightful and entertaining book that helps you understand computers and their impact on the world in a whole new way.  This is a rare book that explains the impact of the digital explosion in a way that everyone can understand and, at the same time, challenges experts to think in new ways.” –Anne Margulies, Assistant Secretary for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts   “Blown to Bits is fun and fundamental. What a pleasure to see real teachers offering such excellent framework for students in a digital age to explore and understand their digital environment, code and law, starting with the insight of Claude Shannon. I look forward to you teaching in an open online school.” –Professor Charles Nesson, Harvard Law School, Founder, Berkman Center for Internet and Society   “To many of us, computers and the Internet are magic. We make stuff, send stuff, receive stuff, and buy stuff. It’s all pointing, clicking, copying, and pasting. But it’s all mysterious. This book explains in clear and comprehensive terms how all this gear on my desk works and why we should pay close attention to these revolutionary changes in our lives. It’s a brilliant and necessary work for consumers, citizens, and students of all ages.” –Siva Vaidhyanathan, cultural historian and media scholar at the University of Virginia and author of Copyrights and Copywrongs: The Rise of Intellectual Property and How it Threatens Creativity      “The world has turned into the proverbial elephant and we the blind men. The old and the young among us risk being controlled by, rather than in control of, events and technologies. Blown to Bits is a remarkable and essential Rosetta Stone for beginning to figure out how all of the pieces of the new world we have just begun to enter–law, technology, culture, information–are going to fit together. Will life explode with new possibilities, or contract under pressure of new horrors? The precipice is both exhilarating and frightening. Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, and Harry Lewis, together, have ably managed to describe the elephant. Readers of this compact book describing the beginning stages of a vast human adventure will be one jump ahead, for they will have a framework on which to hang new pieces that will continue to appear with remarkable speed. To say that this is a ‘must read’ sounds trite, but, this time, it’s absolutely true.” –Harvey Silverglate, criminal defense and civil liberties lawyer and writer   Every day, billions of photographs, news stories, songs, X-rays, TV shows, phone calls, and emails are being scattered around the world as sequences of zeroes and ones: bits. We can’t escape this explosion of digital information and few of us want to–the benefits are too seductive. The technology has enabled unprecedented innovation, collaboration, entertainment, and democratic participation.   But the same engineering marvels are shattering centuries-old assumptions about privacy, identity, free expression, and personal control as more and more details of our lives are captured as digital data.   Can you control who sees all that personal information about you? Can email be truly confidential, when nothing seems to be private? Shouldn’t the Internet be censored the way radio and TV are? Is it really a federal crime to download music? When you use Google or Yahoo! to search for something, how do they decide which sites to show you? Do you still have free speech in the digital world? Do you have a voice in shaping government or corporate policies about any of this?    Blown to Bits offers provocative answers to these questions and tells intriguing real-life stories. This book is a wake-up call to the human consequences of the digital explosion.   Preface xiii   Chapter 1: Digital Explosion: Why Is It Happening, and What Is at Stake? 1 Chapter 2: Naked in the Sunlight: Privacy Lost, Privacy Abandoned 19 Chapter 3: Ghosts in the Machine: Secrets and Surprises of Electronic Documents 73 Chapter 4: Needles in the Haystack: Google and Other Brokers in the Bits Bazaar 109 Chapter 5: Secret Bits: How Codes Became Unbreakable 161 Chapter 6: Balance Toppled: Who Owns the Bits? 195 Chapter 7: You Can’t Say That on the Internet: Guarding the Frontiers of Digital Expression 229 Chapter 8: Bits in the Air: Old Metaphors, New Technologies, and Free Speech 259   Conclusion: After the Explosion 295 Appendix: The Internet as System and Spirit 301 Endnotes 317 Index 347","author":[{"family":"Abelson","given":"Hal"},{"family":"Ledeen","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Harry"}],"citation-key":"abelsonBlown2008","edition":"1st edition","event-place":"Upper Saddle River, NJ","ISBN":"978-0-13-713559-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,16]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"384","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","publisher-place":"Upper Saddle River, NJ","source":"Amazon","title":"Blown to Bits: Your Life, Liberty, and Happiness After the Digital Explosion","title-short":"Blown to Bits","type":"book","URL":"http://www.bitsbook.com/excerpts/"},
  {"id":"adamicInformation2014","abstract":"Social networks readily transmit information, albeit with less than perfect fidelity. We present a large-scale measurement of this imperfect information copying mechanism by examining the dissemination and evolution of thousands of memes, collectively replicated hundreds of millions of times in the online social network Facebook. The information undergoes an evolutionary process that exhibits several regularities. A meme's mutation rate characterizes the population distribution of its variants, in accordance with the Yule process. Variants further apart in the diffusion cascade have greater edit distance, as would be expected in an iterative, imperfect replication process. Some text sequences can confer a replicative advantage; these sequences are abundant and transfer \"laterally\" between different memes. Subpopulations of the social network can preferentially transmit a specific variant of a meme if the variant matches their beliefs or culture. Understanding the mechanism driving change in diffusing information has important implications for how we interpret and harness the information that reaches us through our social networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Adamic","given":"Lada A."},{"family":"Lento","given":"Thomas M."},{"family":"Adar","given":"Eytan"},{"family":"Ng","given":"Pauline C."}],"citation-key":"adamicInformation2014","container-title":"arXiv:1402.6792 [physics]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2,27]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Information Evolution in Social Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6792"},

  {"id":"albertError2000","abstract":"Many complex systems, such as communication networks, display a surprising degree of robustness: while key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. In this paper we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems, but it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks. We find that scale-free networks, describing a number of systems, such as the World Wide Web, Internet, social networks or a cell, display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected by even unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price: these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks, i.e. to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play the most important role in assuring the network's connectivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Albert","given":"Reka"},{"family":"Jeong","given":"Hawoong"},{"family":"Barabasi","given":"Albert-Laszlo"}],"citation-key":"albertError2000","container-title":"arXiv:cond-mat/0008064","DOI":"10.1038/35019019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",8,3]]},"note":"Nature 406, 378-382 (2000)","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Error and attack tolerance of complex networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0008064"},

The existence of a phase transition governed by the value of the scale-free exponent of the network is shown analytically by analyzing the overlap between two distinct trajectories. The phase diagram shows that the phase transition occurs for values of the scale-free exponent in the open interval (2,2.5). Since the Boolean networks under study are directed graphs, the scale-free topology of the input connections and that of the output connections are studied separately. Ultimately these two topologies are shown to be equivalent.

  {"id":"aleGeneral2013","abstract":"Moment approximation methods are gaining increasing attention for their use in the approximation of the stochastic kinetics of chemical reaction systems. In this paper we derive a general moment expansion method for any type of propensities and which allows expansion up to any number of moments. For some chemical reaction systems, more than two moments are necessary to describe the dynamic properties of the system, which the linear noise approximation (LNA) is unable to provide. Moreover, also for systems for which the mean does not have a strong dependence on higher order moments, moment approximation methods give information about higher order moments of the underlying probability distribution. We demonstrate the method using a dimerisation reaction, Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a model of an oscillating p53 system. We show that for the dimerisation reaction and Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics system higher order moments have limited influence on the estimation of the mean, while for the p53 system, the solution for the mean can require several moments to converge to the average obtained from many stochastic simulations. We also find that agreement between lower order moments does not guarantee that higher moments will agree. Compared to stochastic simulations our approach is numerically highly efficient at capturing the behaviour of stochastic systems in terms of the average and higher moments, and we provide expressions for the computational cost for different system sizes and orders of approximation. {We show how the moment expansion method can be employed to efficiently {quantify parameter sensitivity}.} Finally we investigate the effects of using too few moments on parameter estimation, and provide guidance on how to estimate if the distribution can be accurately approximated using only a few moments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Ale","given":"Angelique"},{"family":"Kirk","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Stumpf","given":"Michael P.

First we show that the dynamics of a dichotomous stationary process with long-range correlations such as that used to model DNA sequences should correspond to Lévy statistics and not to FBM. To explain why, in spite of this, the statistical analysis of the data seems to be compatible with FBM, we notice that an initial Gaussian condition, generated by a process foreign to the mechanism establishing the long-range correlations and consequently implying a departure from the stationary condition, is maintained approximately unchanged for very long times. This is so because due to the nature itself of the long-range correlation process, it takes virtually an infinite time for the system to reach the genuine stationary state. Then we discuss a possible generator of initial Gaussian conditions, based on a folding mechanism of the nucleic acid in the cell nucleus. The model adopted is compatible with the known biological and physical constraints, namely, it is shown to be consistent with the information of current biological literature on folding as well as with the statistical analyses of DNA sequences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Allegrini","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Buiatti","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Grigolini","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"West","given":"Bruce J."}],"citation-key":"allegriniFractional1998","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

  {"id":"allenEvolutionary2016","abstract":"The structure of a biological population affects the outcome of evolutionary processes. Understanding evolution in structured populations is difficult. Precise results have been absent for a long time, but have recently emerged for the special case where each individual has the same number of neighbors. But the general problem of determining natural selection, when the number of neighbors varies, has remained open. For arbitrary selection intensity, the problem is in a computational complexity class which suggests there is no efficient algorithm. But whether there exists a simple solution for weak selection was unanswered. Here we provide, surprisingly, a general formula for weak selection that holds for any graph.

  {"id":"allenLimitations2013","abstract":"Until recently, inclusive fitness has been widely accepted as a general method to explain the evolution of social behavior. Affirming and expanding earlier criticism, we demonstrate that inclusive fitness is instead a limited concept, which exists only for a small subset of evolutionary processes. Inclusive fitness assumes that personal fitness is the sum of additive components caused by individual actions. This assumption does not hold for the majority of evolutionary processes or scenarios. To sidestep this limitation, inclusive fitness theorists have proposed a method using linear regression. On the basis of this method, it is claimed that inclusive fitness theory (i) predicts the direction of allele frequency changes, (ii) reveals the reasons for these changes, (iii) is as general as natural selection, and (iv) provides a universal design principle for evolution. In this paper we evaluate these claims, and show that all of them are unfounded. If the objective is to analyze whether mutations that modify social behavior are favored or opposed by natural selection, then no aspect of inclusive fitness theory is needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Allen","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Martin A."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Edward O."}],"citation-key":"allenLimitations2013","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1317588110","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"50","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,12]]},"language":"en","page":"20135-20139","PMID":"24277847","source":"www.pnas.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca","title":"Limitations of inclusive fitness","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/content/110/50/20135","volume":"110"},

  {"id":"amerongenmaddisonNetworks2016","abstract":"The majority of terrestrial plants associate with fungi in symbiotic resource-exchange relationships called mycorrhizae. Mycorrhizal networks (MNs) arise when the same fungus is connected to multiple plants, allowing for interplant resource transfer and impacting ecosystem functions. Recent work suggests MNs also transfer defense-related information from pathogen-, herbivore-, or mechanically-damaged plants to unharmed neighbors. I investigated the defense pathways involved in defense-related signal transfer in ectomycorrhizal systems. Paired Douglas-fir seedlings were grown with varying levels of belowground connectivity (soil water only; soil water and MNs; soil water, MNs, and roots), and a defense response was stimulated in donor seedlings by methyl jasmonate. After 24 and 48 hrs, I measured expression of two regulatory genes on the jasmonate and ethylene pathways. Receiver response was unrelated to hormone treatment of donors in either gene, but the jasmonate response of donor and receiver pairs was correlated across treatments. Positive expression of both genes across donors and receivers and pervasive presence of spider mites suggested signal transfer may either have not occurred or been masked by already ongoing defensive responses. Results indicate the complexity of these systems, and further work is needed to better characterize defense signal transfer via ectomycorrhizal networks. Because of the importance of these mycorrhizal systems to ecosystem functioning, it is crucial that resource managers and scientists have a good understanding of mycorrhizal ecology. However, lower student interest in plants and fungi combined with difficulties visualizing belowground processes present challenges for teaching and learning mycorrhizal concepts. To address this, I co-created the digital plant-centric action-based game Shroomroot for use in lower level postsecondary settings. I conducted a pre-test/post-test evaluation of Shroomroot in a 2nd year postsecondary Introduction to Soil Science course. Students’ knowledge of mycorrhizal ecology increased after playing Shroomroot, and engagement with mycorrhizal content tended to increase after gameplay. These exploratory results suggest positive potential for action-based plant-oriented digital games in the higher education classrooms. Both studies focus on improving our understanding of mycorrhizae and mycorrhizal networks, ecologically and pedagogically.

It represents proteins and other molecules of interest with point-like particles that diffuse, interact with surfaces, and react, all in continuous space. This high level of detail allows users to investigate spatial organization within cells and natural stochastic variability. Although similar to the MCell and ChemCell programs, Smoldyn is more accurate and runs faster. Smoldyn also supports many unique features, such as commands that a “virtual experimenter” can execute during simulations and automatic reaction network expansion for simulating protein complexes. We illustrate Smoldyn's capabilities with a model of signaling between yeast cells of opposite mating type. It investigates the role of the secreted protease Bar1, which inactivates mating pheromone. Intuitively, it might seem that inactivating most of the pheromone would make a cell less able to detect the local pheromone concentration gradient. In contrast, we found that Bar1 secretion improves pheromone gradient detectability: the local gradient is sharpened because pheromone is progressively inactivated as it diffuses through a cloud of Bar1. This result helps interpret experiments that showed that Bar1 secretion helped cells distinguish between potential mates, and suggests that Bar1 helps yeast cells identify the fittest mating partners.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Andrews","given":"Steven S."},{"family":"Addy","given":"Nathan J."},{"family":"Brent","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Arkin","given":"Adam P."}],"citation-key":"andrewsDetailed2010","container-title":"PLoS Comput Biol","container-title-short":"PLoS Comput Biol","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000705","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",3,12]]},"page":"e1000705","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Detailed Simulations of Cell Biology with Smoldyn 2.1","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000705","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"antonioGrowth2014","abstract":"Brazil holds approximately 1/3 of population living infected with AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) in Central and South Americas, and it was also the first developing country to implement a large-scale control and intervention program against AIDS epidemic. In this scenario, we investigate the temporal evolution and current status of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil. Specifically, we analyze records of annual absolute frequency of cases for more than 5000 cities for the first 33 years of the infection in Brazil. We found that (i) the annual absolute frequencies exhibit a logistic-type growth with an exponential regime in the first few years of the AIDS spreading; (ii) the actual reproduction number decaying as a power law; (iii) the distribution of the annual absolute frequencies among cities decays with a power law behavior; (iv) the annual absolute frequencies and the number of inhabitants have an allometric relationship; (v) the temporal evolution of the annual absolute frequencies have different profile depending on the average annual absolute frequencies in the cities. These findings yield a general quantitative description of the AIDS infection dynamics in Brazil since the beginning. They also provide clues about the effectiveness of treatment and control programs against the infection, that has had a different impact depending on the number of inhabitants of cities. In this framework, our results give insights into the overall dynamics of AIDS epidemic, which may contribute to select empirically accurate models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Antonio","given":"F.

The hardest setup for the attainment of cooperation in a population of individuals is the Public Goods game in which cooperative agents generate a common good at their own expenses, while defectors \"free-ride\" this good. Eventually this causes the exhaustion of the good, a situation which is bad for everybody. Previous results have shown that introducing reputation, allowing for volunteer participation, punishing defectors, rewarding cooperators or structuring agents, can enhance cooperation. Here we present a model which shows how the introduction of rare, malicious agents -that we term jokers- performing just destructive actions on the other agents induce bursts of cooperation. The appearance of jokers promotes a rock-paper-scissors dynamics, where jokers outbeat defectors and cooperators outperform jokers, which are subsequently invaded by defectors. Thus, paradoxically, the existence of destructive agents acting indiscriminately promotes cooperation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Arenas","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Camacho","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Cuesta","given":"José A."},{"family":"Requejo","given":"Rubén"}],"citation-key":"arenasJoker2011","container-title":"arXiv:1103.3257","DOI":"10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.03.017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",3,16]]},"note":"J.

We here show that this diversity of decision systems corresponds to a single and optimal rule of decision-making in collectives.

We then tested this rule in decision experiments using zebrafish (Danio rerio), and in existing rich datasets of argentine ants (Linepithema humile) and sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), showing that a unified model across species can quantitatively explain the diversity of decision systems.

  {"id":"arthurAsset1996","abstract":"We propose a theory of asset pricing based on heterogeneous agents who continually adapt their expectations to the market that these expectations aggregatively create. And we explore the implications of this theory computationally using our Santa Fe artificial stock market. Asset markets, we argue, have a recursive nature in that agents' expectations are formed on the basis of their anticipations of other agents' expectations, which precludes expectations being formed by deductive means. Instead traders continually hypothesize-continually explore-expectational models, buy or sell on the basis of those that perform best, and confirm or discard these according to their performance. Thus individual beliefs or expectations become endogenous to the market, and constantly compete within an ecology of others' beliefs or expectations. The ecology of beliefs co-evolves over time. Computer experiments with this endogenous-expectations market explain one of the more striking puzzles in finance: that market traders often believe in such concepts as technical trading, market psychology, and bandwagon effects, while academic theorists believe in market efficiency and a lack of speculative opportunities. Both views, we show, are correct, but within different regimes. Within a regime where investors explore alternative expectational models at a low rate, the market settles into the rational-expectations equilibrium of the efficient-market literature. Within a regime where the rate of exploration of alternative expectations is higher, the market self-organizes into a complex pattern. It acquires a rich psychology, technical trading emerges, temporary bubbles and crashes occur, and asset prices and trading volume show statistical features-in particular, GARCH behavior-characteristic of actual market data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Arthur","given":"W.

The question has therefore arisen of whether correlation is amplified by the vicinity to some critical point in the parameters space. Biological systems, though, are typically quite far from the thermodynamic limit, so that the value of the control parameter at which correlation and susceptibility peak depend on size. Hence, a system would need to readjust its control parameter according to its size in order to be maximally correlated. This readjustment, though, has never been observed experimentally. By gathering three-dimensional data on swarms of midges in the field we find that swarms tune their control parameter and size so as to maintain a scaling behaviour of the correlation function. As a consequence, correlation length and susceptibility scale with the system's size and swarms exhibit a near-maximal degree of correlation at all sizes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Attanasi","given":"A."},{"family":"Cavagna","given":"A."},{"family":"Del Castello","given":"L."},{"family":"Giardina","given":"I."},{"family":"Melillo","given":"S."},{"family":"Parisi","given":"L."},{"family":"Pohl","given":"O."},{"family":"Rossaro","given":"B."},{"family":"Shen","given":"E."},{"family":"Silvestri","given":"E."},{"family":"Viale","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"attanasiFinitesize2014","container-title":"Physical Review Letters","DOI":"10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.238102","ISSN":"0031-9007, 1079-7114","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12,1]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Finite-size scaling as a way to probe near-criticality in natural swarms","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6975","volume":"113"},

As p is varied, this model undergoes a second-order kinetic phase transition from a chemically reactive state with a partial occupation of the lattice to a completely covered state that corresponds to the ‘‘poisoning’’ phenomenon seen on catalysts. The transition is studied both analytically through various mean-field approximations and numerically in one, two, and three dimensions. Finite-size-scaling analysis of the critical behavior is used to find the static and dynamic critical exponents.

On the assumption that interactions between pairs of individuals occur on a probabilistic basis, a model is developed based on the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy in the context of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Deductions from the model, and the results of a computer tournament show how cooperation based on reciprocity can get started in an asocial world, can thrive while interacting with a wide range of other strategies, and can resist invasion once fully established.

The 62 entrants were able to draw lessons from the results of the first round and were able to design their entries to take these lessons into account. The results of the second round demonstrate a number of subtle pitfalls which specific types of decision rules can encounter. The winning rule was once again TIT FOR TAT, the rule which cooperates on the first move and then does what the other player did on the previous move.

The novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of the book. The text focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra.The third edition contains major improvements and revisions throughout the book. More than 300 new exercises have been added since the previous edition. Many new examples have been added to illustrate the key ideas of linear algebra. New topics covered in the book include product spaces, quotient spaces, and dual spaces. Beautiful new formatting creates pages with an unusually pleasant appearance in both print and electronic versions.No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand for suitable mathematical maturity. Thus the text starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and dimension. The book then deals with linear maps, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner-product spaces are introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem and its consequences. Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator.","author":[{"family":"Axler","given":"Sheldon"}],"citation-key":"axlerLinear2014","edition":"3rd edition","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,5]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"357","publisher":"Springer","source":"Amazon","title":"Linear Algebra Done Right","type":"book"},

For example, there is a widely used and successful theory of \"chemical reaction networks\", which describes the interactions of molecules in a stochastic rather than quantum way.

But if we look at these theories from the perspective of quantum theory, they turn out to involve creation and annihilation operators, coherent states and other well-known ideas - but in a context where probabilities replace amplitudes. We explain this connection as part of a detailed analogy between quantum mechanics and stochastic mechanics. We use this analogy to present new proofs of two major results in the theory of chemical reaction networks: the deficiency zero theorem and the Anderson-Craciun-Kurtz theorem. We also study the overlap of quantum mechanics and stochastic mechanics, which involves Hamiltonians that can generate either unitary or stochastic time evolution.

This class of models includes among others the directed percolation problem (Domany Kinzel model) and the dynamical Ising model. The critical properties of these models are usually obtained by fine-tuning one or more control parameters, as for instance the temperature. We present a method for the parallel evolution of the model for all the values of the control parameter, although its implementation is in general limited to a fixed number of values. This algorithm facilitates the sketching of phase diagrams and can be useful in deriving the critical properties of the model.

In doing so, they set other species back in evolution, thereby maintaining a steady fraction of evolving species. The evolutionary activity of the steady state is a natural order parameter for the ecosystem. Closed expressions are given for this order parameter and for the system’s relaxation time.

We construct simple models of a stock market, and argue that the large variations may be due to a crowd effect, where agents imitate each other's behavior. The variations over different time scales can be related to each other in a systematic way, similar to the Levy stable distribution proposed by Mandelbrot to describe real market indices. In the simplest, least realistic case, exact results for the statistics of the variations are derived by mapping onto a model of diffusing and annihilating particles, which has been solved by quantum field theory methods. When the agents imitate each other and respond to recent market volatility, different scaling behavior is obtained. In this case the statistics of price variations is consistent with empirical observations. The interplay between ``rational'' traders whose behavior is derived from fundamental analysis of the stock, including dividends, and ``noise traders'', whose behavior is governed solely by studying the market dynamics, is investigated. When the relative number of rational traders is small, ``bubbles'' often occur, where the market price moves outside the range justified by fundamental market analysis. When the number of rational traders is larger, the market price is generally locked within the price range they define.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bak","given":"P."},{"family":"Paczuski","given":"M."},{"family":"Shubik","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"bakPrice1996","container-title":"arXiv:cond-mat/9609144","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",9,16]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Price Variations in a Stock Market With Many Agents","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9609144"},

However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.\nanimal groups behavioral rules flocking self-organization","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Ballerini","given":"M."},{"family":"Cabibbo","given":"N."},{"family":"Candelier","given":"R."},{"family":"Cavagna","given":"A."},{"family":"Cisbani","given":"E."},{"family":"Giardina","given":"I."},{"family":"Lecomte","given":"V."},{"family":"Orlandi","given":"A."},{"family":"Parisi","given":"G."},{"family":"Procaccini","given":"A."},{"family":"Viale","given":"M."},{"family":"Zdravkovic","given":"V."}],"citation-key":"balleriniInteraction2008","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0711437105","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",1,29]]},"language":"en","page":"1232-1237","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Interaction ruling animal collective behavior depends on topological rather than metric distance: Evidence from a field study","title-short":"Interaction ruling animal collective behavior depends on topological rather than metric distance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/105/4/1232","volume":"105"},

  {"id":"barakEnhancing2005","abstract":"Project-based learning (PBL), which is increasingly supported by information technologies (IT), contributes to fostering student-directed scientific inquiry of problems in a real-world setting. This study investigated the integration of PBL in an IT environment into three undergraduate chemistry courses, each including both experimental and control students. Students in the experimental group volunteered to carry out an individual IT-based project, whereas the control students solved only traditional problems. The project included constructing computerized molecular models, seeking information on scientific phenomena, and inquiring about chemistry theories. The effect of the PBL was examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative analysis was based on a pretest, a posttest, and a final examination, which served for comparing the learning gains of the two research groups. For the qualitative analysis, we looked into the experimental students' performance, as reflected by the projects they had submitted. In addition, “think alou” interviews and observations helped us gain insight into the students' conceptual understanding of molecular structures. Students who participated in the IT-enhanced PBL performed significantly better than their control classmates not only on their posttest but also on their course final examination. Analyzing the qualitative findings, we concluded that the construction of computerized models and Web-based inquiry activities helped promote students' ability of mentally traversing the four levels of chemistry understanding: symbolic, macroscopic, microscopic, and process. More generally, our results indicated that incorporating IT-rich PBL into freshmen courses can enhance students' understanding of chemical concepts, theories, and molecular structures. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the second part of the paper an exact one-dimensional formulation of HMM kinetics is obtained. The whole problem is condensed in a single one-variable evolution equation that is a second-order non-linear differential equation, and the control parameters are reduced to three dimensionless quantities: enzyme efficiency, substrate reduced initial concentration, and enzyme reduced initial concentration. The exact solution of HMM kinetics is obtained as a set of Maclaurin series. From the same equation, a number of approximate solutions, some known, some new, are derived in a systematic way that allows a precise evaluation of the respective level of approximation and conditions of validity. The evolution equation derived is also shown to be well suited for the numerical computation of the concentrations of all species as a function of time for any given combination of parameters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Berberan-Santos","given":"Mario N."}],"citation-key":"berberan-santosExact2009","genre":"arXiv e-print","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5,6]]},"number":"0905.0874","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Exact and approximate solutions for a century-old problem: A general treatment of Henri-Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics","title-short":"Exact and approximate solutions for a century-old problem","type":"report","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0874"},

We start with the sim ulation environment of Hinton and Nowlan in which individual learning was shown to guide genetic evolution towards a difficult adaptive goal. We then consider, in lieu of individual learn ing, culture in the form of social learning by imitation. Our results demonstrate that when genes and culture cooperate, or enhance one another, culture too is able to guide genetic evolution towards an adaptive goal. Further, we show that social learning is superior to individual learning insofar as it with genetic evolution converges more quickly to the goal. However, the social learn ing algorithm results in slower genetic assimilation of adaptive alleles than with individual learn ing. It is as if, we argue, the adaptive values are stored in the culture rather than in the genes. Finally, we consider what happens when culture and genes pursue diametrically opposed goals. Here we show that culture, in the form of social learning, is no real match when opposed to genet ic evolution with individual learning. In fact, only the most herculean of social learning algorithms is able to keep a neutralizing toe-hold against the slow plodding force of genetic evolution. Finally, our results suggest that in both cases, opposition and enhancement, transmission forces such as the ratio of teacher to learner are central to the success of social learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Best","given":"Michael L"}],"citation-key":"bestHow1999","container-title":"Adaptive Behavior","container-title-short":"Adaptive Behavior","DOI":"10.1177/105971239900700305","ISSN":"1059-7123, 1741-2633","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",1,1]]},"page":"289-306","source":"adb.sagepub.com","title":"How Culture Can Guide Evolution: An Inquiry into Gene/Meme Enhancement and Opposition","title-short":"How Culture Can Guide Evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://adb.sagepub.com/content/7/3-4/289","volume":"7"},

It is not just that thousands of individuals fly, on average, in the same direction and at the same speed, but that even the fluctuations around the mean velocity are correlated over long distances. Quantitative measurements on flocks of starlings, in particular, show that these fluctuations are scale-free, with effective correlation lengths proportional to the linear size of the flock. Here we construct models for the joint distribution of velocities in the flock that reproduce the observed local correlations between individuals and their neighbors, as well as the variance of flight speeds across individuals, but otherwise have as little structure as possible. These minimally structured, or maximum entropy models provide quantitative, parameter-free predictions for the spread of correlations throughout the flock, and these are in excellent agreement with the data. These models are mathematically equivalent to statistical physics models for ordering in magnets, and the correct prediction of scale-free correlations arises because the parameters - completely determined by the data - are in the critical regime.

  {"id":"biondoTalent2018","abstract":"The largely dominant meritocratic paradigm of highly competitive Western cultures is rooted on the belief that success is due mainly, if not exclusively, to personal qualities such as talent, intelligence, skills, efforts or risk taking. Sometimes, we are willing to admit that a certain degree of luck could also play a role in achieving significant material success. But, as a matter of fact, it is rather common to underestimate the importance of external forces in individual successful stories. It is very well known that intelligence or talent exhibit a Gaussian distribution among the population, whereas the distribution of wealth - considered a proxy of success - follows typically a power law (Pareto law). Such a discrepancy between a Normal distribution of inputs, with a typical scale, and the scale invariant distribution of outputs, suggests that some hidden ingredient is at work behind the scenes. In this paper, with the help of a very simple agent-based model, we suggest that such an ingredient is just randomness. In particular, we show that, if it is true that some degree of talent is necessary to be successful in life, almost never the most talented people reach the highest peaks of success, being overtaken by mediocre but sensibly luckier individuals. As to our knowledge, this counterintuitive result - although implicitly suggested between the lines in a vast literature - is quantified here for the first time. It sheds new light on the effectiveness of assessing merit on the basis of the reached level of success and underlines the risks of distributing excessive honors or resources to people who, at the end of the day, could have been simply luckier than others. With the help of this model, several policy hypotheses are also addressed and compared to show the most efficient strategies for public funding of research in order to improve meritocracy, diversity and innovation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Biondo","given":"A.

  {"id":"blackMixing2012","abstract":"Without mutation and migration, evolutionary dynamics ultimately leads to the extinction of all but one species. Such fixation processes are well understood and can be characterized analytically with methods from statistical physics. However, many biological arguments focus on stationary distributions in a mutation-selection equilibrium. Here, we address the equilibration time required to reach stationarity in the presence of mutation, this is known as the mixing time in the theory of Markov processes. We show that mixing times in evolutionary games have the opposite behaviour from fixation times when the intensity of selection increases: In coordination games with bistabilities, the fixation time decreases, but the mixing time increases. In coexistence games with metastable states, the fixation time increases, but the mixing time decreases.

  {"id":"blackmoreMeme2000","abstract":"What is a meme? First coined by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene, a meme is any idea, behavior, or skill that can be transferred from one person to another by imitation: stories, fashions, inventions, recipes, songs, ways of plowing a field or throwing a baseball or making a sculpture. The meme is also one of the most important--and controversial--concepts to emerge since The Origin of the Species appeared nearly 150 years ago. In The Meme Machine Susan Blackmore boldly asserts: \"Just as the design of our bodies can be understood only in terms of natural selection, so the design of our minds can be understood only in terms of memetic selection.\" Indeed, Blackmore shows that once our distant ancestors acquired the crucial ability to imitate, a second kind of natural selection began, a survival of the fittest amongst competing ideas and behaviors. Ideas and behaviors that proved most adaptive--making tools, for example, or using language--survived and flourished, replicating themselves in as many minds as possible.

We assume here that each node has a feature which attracts the others. We model the situation by assigning two numbers to each node, ω and α, where ω indicates some property of the node and α the affinity towards that property. A node A is more likely to establish a connection with a node B if B has a high value of ω and A has a high value of α. Simple computer simulations show that networks built according to this principle have a degree distribution with a power-law tail, whose exponent is determined only by the nodes with the largest value of the affinity α (the “extremists”). This means that the extremists lead the formation process of the network and manage to shape the final topology of the system. The latter phenomenon may have implications in the study of social networks and in epidemiology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Blanchard","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Fortunato","given":"Santo"},{"family":"Krüger","given":"Tyll"}],"citation-key":"blanchardImportance2005","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

  {"id":"blokLife1995","abstract":"Recently, a class of phenomena known as self-organized criticality (SOC) has been\ndiscovered. SOC is characterized by two properties: firstly, the system exhibits power law\nbehavior typical of a critical state, with no characteristic time or length scales; and\nsecondly, this state is approached naturally, without tuning any external parameters. Early\nstudies explained SOC in terms of conserved quantities [1,2]. Then Bak et al. [3]\nsuggested that the Game of Life, GL, a cellular automaton lacking any conserved\nquantities, also exhibited SOC. This sparked a debate as to whether GL truly is SOC;\nconflicting data suggested it was subcritical [4,5,6].\nIn this paper I explore both sides of the argument in an attempt to resolve the\nissue. By finding an explicit form for the scaling function the opposing arguments are\nreconciled and, with some slight reservations, GL is judged to be subcritical. The\ndifferences between the analysis herein and other studies is highlighted.\nI also introduce the reader to some other interesting features of GL, and cellular\nautomata in general, in order to elicit the proper respect for these simple yet complex\nmodels. In doing so I hope to impress upon the reader the insufficiencies of the available\nanalytical tools. New methods are required to account for the long-range correlations\nwhich develop in GL and other deterministic automata.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Blok","given":"Hendrik J.

  {"id":"blokNature2000b","abstract":"Over the last few years there has been a surge of activity within the physics community in the emerging field of Econophysics—the study of economic systems from a physicist's perspective. Physicists tend to take a different view than economists and other social scientists, being interested in such topics as phase transitions and fluctuations. In this dissertation two simple models of stock exchange are developed and simulated numerically. The first is characterized by centralized trading with a market maker. Fluctuations are driven by a stochastic component in the agents' forecasts. As the scale of the fluctuations is varied a critical phase transition is discovered. Unfortunately, this model is unable to generate realistic market dynamics. The second model discards the requirement of centralized trading. In this case the stochastic driving force is Gaussian-distributed \"news events\" which are public knowledge. Under variation of the control parameter the model exhibits two phase transitions: both a first- and a second-order (critical). The decentralized model is able to capture many of the interesting properties observed in empirical markets such as fat tails in the distribution of returns, a brief memory in the return series, and long-range correlations in volatility. Significantly, these properties only emerge when the parameters are tuned such that the model spans the critical point. This suggests that real markets may operate at or near a critical point, but is unable to explain why this should be. This remains an interesting open question worth further investigation. One of the main points of the thesis is that these empirical phenomena are not present in the stochastic driving force, but emerge endogenously from interactions between agents. Further, they emerge despite the simplicity of the modeled agents; suggesting complex market dynamics do not arise from the complexity of individual investors but simply from interactions between (even simple) investors. Although the emphasis of this thesis is on the extent to which multi-agent models can produce complex dynamics, some attempt is also made to relate this work with empirical data. Firstly, the trading strategy applied by the agents in the second model is demonstrated to be adequate, if not optimal, and to have some surprising consequences. Secondly, the claim put forth by Sornette et al. that large financial crashes may be heralded by accelerating precursory oscillations is also tested. It is shown that there is weak evidence for the existence of log-periodic precursors but the signal is probably too indistinct to allow for reliable predictions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Blok","given":"Hendrik J.

Several authors have pointed out an analogy with kinetic theory, which describes molecules whose momentum and energy changes due to interactions with other molecules. We pursue this analogy and derive a Boltzmann equation for the time evolution of the wealth distribution of a population of agents for the so-called Yard-Sale Model of wealth exchange. We examine the solutions to this equation by a combination of analytical and numerical methods, and investigate its long-time limit. We study an important limit of this equation for small transaction sizes, and derive a partial integrodifferential equation governing the evolution of the wealth distribution in a closed economy. We then describe how this model may be extended to include features such as production, inflation, and taxation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Boghosian","given":"Bruce M."}],"citation-key":"boghosianKinetics2012","container-title":"arXiv:1212.6300","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,26]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Kinetics of Wealth and the Origin of the Pareto Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6300"},

We solve this model analytically and observe a phase transition between a one state phase, always allowing for a stable money value, and a two state phase, where an unstable (inflationary) phase occurs.

In the absence of diffusion, the bifurcation diagram displays regions of both finite population density and zero population density, i.e., extinction. The early signatures of the transition to extinction at a bifurcation point are computed in the presence of additive noise. For the full RD model, the existence of travelling wave solutions of the population density is demonstrated. The parameter regimes in which the travelling wave advances (range expansion) and retreats are identified. In the weak Allee regime, the transition from the pushed to the pulled wave is shown as a function of the mortality rate constant.

We investigate a mean-field limit of this equation and show that the distribution of wealth is of the Pareto (power-law) type. The Pareto behaviour of the tails of this distribution appears to be robust for finite range models, as shown using both a mapping to the random ‘directed polymer’ problem, as well as numerical simulations. In this context, a phase transition between an economy dominated by a few individuals and a situation where the wealth is more evenly spread out, is found. An interesting outcome is that the distribution of wealth tends to be very broadly distributed when exchanges are limited, either in amplitude or topologically.

  {"id":"briggsMultigrid2000","abstract":"Twelve years have passed since the publication of the first edition of A Multigrid Tutorial. During those years, the field of multigrid and multilevel methods has expanded at a tremendous rate, reflecting progress in the development and analysis of algorithms and in the evolution of computing environments. Because of these changes, the first edition of the book has become increasingly outdated and the need for a new edition has become quite apparent. With the overwhelming growth in the subject, an area in which I have never done serious research, I felt remarkably unqualified to attempt a new edition. Realizing that I needed some help, I recruited two experts to assist with the project. Steve McCormick (Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Colorado at Boulder) is one of the original researchers in the field of multigrid methods and the real instigator of the first edition. There could be no better collaborator on the subject. Van Emden Henson (Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) has specialized in applications of multigrid methods, with a particular emphasis on algebraic multigrid methods. Our collaboration on a previous SIAM monograph made him an obvious choice as a co-author. With the team in place, we began deliberating on the content of the new edition. It was agreed that the first edition should remain largely intact with little more than some necessary updating. Our aim was to add a roughly equal amount of new material that reflects important core developments in the field. A topic that probably should have been in the first edition comprises Chapter 6: FAS (Full Approximation Scheme), which is used for nonlinear problems. Chapter 7 is a collection of methods for four special situations that arise frequently in solving boundary value problems: Neumann boundary conditions, anisotropic problems, variable-mesh problems, and variable-coefficient problems. One of the chief motivations for writing a second edition was the recent surge of interest in algebraic multigrid methods, which is the subject of Chapter 8. In Chapter 9, we attempt to explain the complex subject of adaptive grid methods, as it appears in the FAC (Fast Adaptive Composite) Grid Method. Finally, in Chapter 10, we depart from the predominantly finite difference approach of the book and show how finite element formulations arise. This chapter provides a natural closing because it ties a knot in the thread of variational principles that runs through much of the book.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Briggs","given":"William L."},{"family":"Henson","given":"Van Emden"},{"family":"McCormick","given":"Steve F."}],"citation-key":"briggsMultigrid2000","collection-title":"Other Titles in Applied Mathematics","DOI":"10.1137/1.9780898719505","ISBN":"978-0-89871-462-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",1,1]]},"number-of-pages":"196","publisher":"Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics","source":"epubs-siam-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca (Atypon)","title":"A Multigrid Tutorial, Second Edition","type":"book","URL":"http://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898719505"},

Here we used multi-model inference (MMI), a form of model averaging, based on information theory (Akaike's Information Criterion) to evaluate the relative strength of evidence for density-dependent and density-independent population dynamical models in long-term abundance time series of 1198 species. We also compared the MMI results to more classic methods for detecting density dependence: Neyman-Pearson hypothesis-testing and best-model selection using the Bayesian Information Criterion or cross-validation. Using MMI on our large database, we show that density dependence is a pervasive feature of population dynamics (median MMI support for density dependence = 74.7-92.2%), and that this holds across widely different taxa. The weight of evidence for density dependence varied among species but increased consistently with the number of generations monitored. Best-model selection methods yielded similar results to MMI (a density-dependent model was favored in 66.2-93.9% of species time series), while the hypothesis-testing methods detected density dependence less frequently (32.6-49.8%). There were no obvious differences in the prevalence of density dependence across major taxonomic groups under any of the statistical methods used. These results underscore the value of using multiple modes of analysis to quantify the relative empirical support for a set of working hypotheses that encompass a range of realistic population dynamical behaviors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Brook","given":"Barry W."},{"family":"Bradshaw","given":"Corey J.

  {"id":"brownWhy2016","abstract":"Humans have marvelled at the fit of form and function, the way organisms' traits seem remarkably suited to their lifestyles and ecologies. While natural selection provides the scientific basis for the fit of form and function, Darwin found certain adaptations vexing or particularly intriguing: sex ratios, sexual selection and altruism. The logic behind these adaptations resides in frequency-dependent selection where the value of a given heritable phenotype (i.e. strategy) to an individual depends upon the strategies of others. Game theory is a branch of mathematics that is uniquely suited to solving such puzzles. While game theoretic thinking enters into Darwin's arguments and those of evolutionists through much of the twentieth century, the tools of evolutionary game theory were not available to Darwin or most evolutionists until the 1970s, and its full scope has only unfolded in the last three decades. As a consequence, game theory is applied and appreciated rather spottily. Game theory not only applies to matrix games and social games, it also applies to speciation, macroevolution and perhaps even to cancer. I assert that life and natural selection are a game, and that game theory is the appropriate logic for framing and understanding adaptations. Its scope can include behaviours within species, state-dependent strategies (such as male, female and so much more), speciation and coevolution, and expands beyond microevolution to macroevolution. Game theory clarifies aspects of ecological and evolutionary stability in ways useful to understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics, niche construction and ecosystem engineering. In short, I would like to think that Darwin would have found game theory uniquely useful for his theory of natural selection. Let us see why this is so.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Joel S."}],"citation-key":"brownWhy2016","container-title":"Proc. R. Soc.

Using a version of the NKCS model we examine the effects of increasing the rate of meme evolution in relation to the rate of gene evolution, for various degrees of interdependence between the two replicators. That is, the effects of memes' (suggested) more rapid rate of evolution in comparison to that of genes is investigated using a tunable model of coevolution. It is found that, for almost any degree of interdependence between the two replicators, as the rate of meme evolution increases, a phase transition-like dynamic occurs under which memes have a significantly detrimental effect on the evolution of genes, quickly resulting in the cessation of effective gene evolution. Conversely, the memes experience a sharp increase in benefit from increasing their rate of evolution. We then examine the effects of enabling genes to reduce the percentage of gene-detrimental evolutionary steps taken by memes. Here a critical region emerges as the comparative rate of meme evolution increases, such that if genes cannot effectively select memes a high percentage of the time, they suffer from meme evolution as if they had almost no selective capability.","author":[{"family":"Bull","given":"Larry"},{"family":"Holland","given":"Owen"},{"family":"Blackmore","given":"Susan"}],"citation-key":"bullMemeGene2000","container-title":"Artificial Life","DOI":"10.1162/106454600568852","ISSN":"1064-5462","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"page":"227-235","source":"MIT Press Journals","title":"On Meme-Gene Coevolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/106454600568852","volume":"6"},

The model describes dynamics of ecological communities on an evolutionary timescale. Species are defined as sets of characteristic features, and these features are used to determine interaction scores between species. A simple rule is used to transfer resources from the external environment through the food web to each of the species, and to determine mean population sizes. A time step in the model represents a speciation event. A new species is added with features similar to those of one of the existing species and a new food web structure is then calculated. The new species may (i) add stably to the web, (ii) become extinct immediately because it is poorly adapted, or (iii) cause one or more other species to become extinct due to competition for resources. We measure various properties of the model webs and compare these with data on real food webs. These properties include the proportions of basal, intermediate and top species, the number of links per species and the number of trophic levels. We also study the evolutionary dynamics of the model ecosystem by following the fluctuations in the total number of species in the web. Extinction avalanches occur when novel organisms arise which are significantly better adapted than existing ones. We discuss these results in relation to the observed extinction events in the fossil record, and to the theory of self-organized criticality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Caldarelli","given":"Guido"},{"family":"Higgs","given":"Paul G"},{"family":"McKane","given":"Alan J"}],"citation-key":"caldarelliModelling1998","container-title":"arXiv:adap-org/9801003","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",1,16]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Modelling coevolution in multispecies communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/adap-org/9801003"},

  {"id":"caldwellSubstance2013","abstract":"Vicodin is the most commonly prescribed pain reliever in the United States. Research indicates that there are two million people who are currently abusing Vicodin, and the majority of those who abuse Vicodin were initially exposed to it via prescription. Our goal is to determine the most effective strategies for reducing the overall population of Vicodin abusers. More specifically, we focus on whether prevention methods aimed at educating doctors and patients on the potential for drug abuse or treatment methods implemented after a person abuses Vicodin will have a greater overall impact. We consider one linear and two non-linear compartmental models in which medical users of Vicodin can transition into the abuser compartment or leave the population by no longer taking the drug. Once Vicodin abusers, people can transition into a treatment compartment, with the possibility of leaving the population through successful completion of treatment or of relapsing and re-entering the abusive compartment. The linear model assumes no social interaction, while both non-linear models consider interaction. One considers interaction with abusers affecting the relapse rate, while the other assumes both this and an additional interaction between the number of abusers and the number of new prescriptions. Sensitivity analyses are conducted varying the rates of success of these intervention methods measured by the parameters to determine which strategy has the greatest impact on controlling the population of Vicodin abusers. From these models and analyses, we determine that manipulating parameters tied to prevention measures has a greater impact on reducing the population of abusers than manipulating parameters associated with treatment. We also note that increasing the rate at which abusers seek treatment affects the population of abusers more than the success rate of treatment itself.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Caldwell","given":"Wendy K."},{"family":"Freedman","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Settles","given":"Luke"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Michael M."},{"family":"Murillo","given":"Anarina"},{"family":"Camacho","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Wirkus","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"caldwellSubstance2013","genre":"arXiv e-print","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,26]]},"number":"1308.3673","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Substance Abuse via Legally Prescribed Drugs: The Case of Vicodin in the United States","title-short":"Substance Abuse via Legally Prescribed Drugs","type":"report","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3673"},

The payoff parameter is set at the critical region $1.8 < b < 2.0$ , where clusters of cooperators are formed in all spatial sizes. Using the factorial moments developed in particle and nuclear physics for the study of phase transition, the distribution of cooperators is studied as a function of the bin size covering varying numbers of lattice cells. From the scaling behaviour of the moments a scaling exponent is determined and is found to lie in the range where phase transitions are known to take place in physical systems. It is therefore inferred that when the payoff parameter is increased through the critical region the biological system of cooperators undergoes a phase transition to defectors.

  {"id":"caoRobust2011","abstract":"Summary Applied scientists often like to use ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model complex dynamic processes that arise in biology, engineering, medicine, and many other areas. It is interesting but challenging to estimate ODE parameters from noisy data, especially when the data have some outliers. We propose a robust method to address this problem. The dynamic process is represented with a nonparametric function, which is a linear combination of basis functions. The nonparametric function is estimated by a robust penalized smoothing method. The penalty term is defined with the parametric ODE model, which controls the roughness of the nonparametric function and maintains the fidelity of the nonparametric function to the ODE model. The basis coefficients and ODE parameters are estimated in two nested levels of optimization. The coefficient estimates are treated as an implicit function of ODE parameters, which enables one to derive the analytic gradients for optimization using the implicit function theorem. Simulation studies show that the robust method gives satisfactory estimates for the ODE parameters from noisy data with outliers. The robust method is demonstrated by estimating a predator–prey ODE model from real ecological data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Cao","given":"J."},{"family":"Wang","given":"L."},{"family":"Xu","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"caoRobust2011","container-title":"Biometrics","DOI":"10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01577.x","ISSN":"1541-0420","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12,1]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2011, The International Biometric Society","page":"1305-1313","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Robust Estimation for Ordinary Differential Equation Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01577.x/abstract","volume":"67"},

  {"id":"centolaExperimental2018","abstract":"Tipping points in social convention\nOnce a population has converged on a consensus, how can a group with a minority viewpoint overturn it? Theoretical models have emphasized tipping points, whereby a sufficiently large minority can change the societal norm. Centola et al. devised a system to study this in controlled experiments. Groups of people who had achieved a consensus about the name of a person shown in a picture were individually exposed to a confederate who promoted a different name. The only incentive was to coordinate. When the number of confederates was roughly 25% of the group, the opinion of the majority could be tipped to that of the minority.\nScience, this issue p. 1116\nTheoretical models of critical mass have shown how minority groups can initiate social change dynamics in the emergence of new social conventions. Here, we study an artificial system of social conventions in which human subjects interact to establish a new coordination equilibrium. The findings provide direct empirical demonstration of the existence of a tipping point in the dynamics of changing social conventions. When minority groups reached the critical mass—that is, the critical group size for initiating social change—they were consistently able to overturn the established behavior. The size of the required critical mass is expected to vary based on theoretically identifiable features of a social setting. Our results show that the theoretically predicted dynamics of critical mass do in fact emerge as expected within an empirical system of social coordination.\nCommitted minorities can overturn established social conventions when a critical size is reached.\nCommitted minorities can overturn established social conventions when a critical size is reached.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Centola","given":"Damon"},{"family":"Becker","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Brackbill","given":"Devon"},{"family":"Baronchelli","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"centolaExperimental2018","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aas8827","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6393","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,8]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

It is shown that criticality, as understood from the point of view of statistical mechanics, is intimately related to the various characteristics of Wolfram's class IV rules. This suggests in turn the picture of a “critical surface” in the space of rules and provides the basis for a discussion of the problem of classification schemes.

They include the excess mass and dip tests, which are equivalent in univariate settings and are alternatives to the bandwidth test. Only very conservative forms of the excess mass and dip tests are available at presently, however, and for that reason they are generally not competitive with the bandwidth test. In the present paper we develop a practical approach to calibrating the excess mass and dip tests to improve their level accuracy and power substantially. Our method exploits the fact that the limiting distribution of the excess mass statistic under the null hypothesis depends on unknowns only through a constant, which may be estimated. Our calibrated test exploits this fact and is shown to have greater power and level accuracy than the bandwidth test has. The latter tends to be quite conservative, even in an asymptotic sense. Moreover, the calibrated test avoids difficulties that the bandwidth test has with spurious modes in the tails, which often must be discounted through subjective intervention of the experimenter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheng","given":"M. ‐Y"},{"family":"Hall","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"chengCalibrating1998","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Statistical Methodology)","DOI":"10.1111/1467-9868.00141","ISSN":"1467-9868","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"579-589","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Calibrating the excess mass and dip tests of modality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9868.00141/abstract","volume":"60"},
  {"id":"chenHow2018","abstract":"This paper investigates randomization on asynchronous exams as a defense against collaborative cheating. Asynchronous exams are those for which students take the exam at different times, potentially across a multi-day exam period. Collaborative cheating occurs when one student (the information producer) takes the exam early and passes information about the exam to other students (the information consumers) that are taking the exam later. Using a dataset of computerized exam and homework problems in a single course with 425 students, we identified 5.5% of students (on average) as information consumers by their disproportionate studying of problems that were on the exam. These information consumers (\"cheaters\") had a significant advantage (13 percentage points on average) when every student was given the same exam problem (even when the parameters are randomized for each student), but that advantage dropped to almost negligible levels (2--3 percentage points) when students were given a random problem from a pool of two or four problems.

  {"id":"chenMinimal2014","abstract":"We propose a minimal model of predator–swarm interactions which captures many of the essential dynamics observed in nature. Different outcomes are observed depending on the predator strength. For a ‘weak’ predator, the swarm is able to escape the predator completely. As the strength is increased, the predator is able to catch up with the swarm as a whole, but the individual prey is able to escape by ‘confusing’ the predator: the prey forms a ring with the predator at the centre. For higher predator strength, complex chasing dynamics are observed which can become chaotic. For even higher strength, the predator is able to successfully capture the prey. Our model is simple enough to be amenable to a full mathematical analysis, which is used to predict the shape of the swarm as well as the resulting predator–prey dynamics as a function of model parameters. We show that, as the predator strength is increased, there is a transition (owing to a Hopf bifurcation) from confusion state to chasing dynamics, and we compute the threshold analytically. Our analysis indicates that the swarming behaviour is not helpful in avoiding the predator, suggesting that there are other reasons why the species may swarm. The complex shape of the swarm in our model during the chasing dynamics is similar to the shape of a flock of sheep avoiding a shepherd.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yuxin"},{"family":"Kolokolnikov","given":"Theodore"}],"citation-key":"chenMinimal2014","container-title":"Journal of The Royal Society Interface","container-title-short":"J.

We show that the spatial distribution of fires forms a novel geometric structure where the fractal dimension varies continuously with the length scale. In the three dimensional model, the dimensions varies from zero to three, proportional with $log(l)$, as the length scale increases from $l \\sim 1$ to a correlation length $l=\\xi$. Beyond the correlation length, which diverges with the growth rate $p$ as ${\\xi} \\propto p^{-2/3}$, the distribution becomes homogeneous. We suggest that this picture applies to the ``intermediate range'' of turbulence where it provides a natural interpretation of the extended scaling that has been observed at small length scales. Unexpectedly, it might also be applicable to the spatial distribution of luminous matter in the universe. In the two-dimensional version, the dimension increases to D=1 at a length scale $l \\sim 1/p$, where there is a cross-over to homogeneity, i. e. a jump from D=1 to D=2.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Kan"},{"family":"Bak","given":"Per"}],"citation-key":"chenScale1999","container-title":"arXiv:cond-mat/9912417","DOI":"10.1103/PhysRevE.62.1613","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",12,22]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Scale Dependent Dimension in the Forest Fire Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9912417"},
  {"id":"chenTesting2001","abstract":"We present a stochastic simulation model of a prototype financial market. Our market is populated by both noise traders and fundamentalist speculators. The dynamics covers switches in the prevailing mood among noise traders (optimistic or pessimistic) as well as switches of agents between the noise trader and fundamentalist group in response to observed differences in profits. The particular behavioral variant adopted by an agent also determines his decision to enter on the long or short side of the market. Short-run imbalances between demand and supply lead to price adjustments by a market maker or auctioneer in the usual Walrasian manner. Our interest in this paper is in exploring the behavior of the model when testing for the presence of chaos or non-linearity in the simulated data. As it turns out, attempts to determine the fractal dimension of the underlying process give unsatisfactory results in that we experience a lack of convergence of the estimate. Explicit tests for non-linearity and dependence (the BDS and Kaplan tests) also give very unstable results in that both acceptance and strong rejection of IIDness can be found in different realizations of our model. All in all, this behavior is very similar to experience collected with empirical data and our results may point towards an explanation of why robustness of inference in this area is low. However, when testing for dependence in second moments and estimating GARCH models, the results appear much more robust and the chosen GARCH specification closely resembles the typical outcome of empirical studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Shu-Heng"},{"family":"Lux","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Marchesi","given":"Michele"}],"citation-key":"chenTesting2001","container-title":"Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization","DOI":"10.1016/S0167-2681(01)00181-0","ISSN":"0167-2681","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",11]]},"page":"327-342","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Testing for non-linear structure in an artificial financial market","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268101001810","volume":"46"},

This approach, however, typically enforces a strictly fixed overall population size, deemphasizing natural growth processes. We study a competitive Lotka-Volterra model, with number fluctuations, that accounts for natural population growth and encompasses interaction scenarios typical of evolutionary games. In an appropriate limit, the model describes standard evolutionary games with both genetic drift and overall population size fluctuations. We demonstrate a novel mechanism for neutral evolution in a well-mixed Moran model such that population size fluctuations favor a fixation of one species over the other. We derive an effective evolutionary dynamics for fluctuation-induced selection by adiabatic elimination of a fast variable. The method can be extended to study the interplay between selection, genetic drift, and population size fluctuations in other scenarios. We also investigate strong mutualism, in a limit where a varying population size can strongly influence the evolutionary dynamics. We analytically and numerically determine fixation probabilities as well as mean fixation times using matched asymptotic expansions, taking into account the population size degree of freedom.

Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution.

  {"id":"cluneEvolutionary2012","abstract":"A central biological question is how natural organisms are so evolvable (capable of quickly adapting to new environments). A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks--their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits--but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. While most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyze research in numerous disciplines, including neuroscience, genetics and harnessing evolution for engineering purposes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Clune","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Mouret","given":"Jean-Baptiste"},{"family":"Lipson","given":"Hod"}],"citation-key":"cluneEvolutionary2012","container-title":"arXiv:1207.2743","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",7,11]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"The evolutionary origins of modularity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2743"},
  {"id":"coenenTeacher2017","abstract":"It has become widely accepted that teachers are important in facilitating student learning. Hundreds of empirical studies have tried to explain differences in student performance by evaluating the impact of particular teacher characteristics. Yet, this topic has not been the subject of a systematic review for more than 10 years, even though most of the empirical evidence has emerged over the past decade. This study provides an up-to-date review, drawing on empirical findings from several countries and distinguishing between acquired and sociodemographic teacher characteristics. This review confirms the existing consensus that subject-related degrees and knowledge, and not general teacher certifications, are positively related to student performance and particularly so for Master's degrees in math and science. A new insight is that recent findings point out that teacher experience continues to contribute to student test scores throughout a teacher's career, instead of merely the first few years. An important future research avenue would be to examine which mechanisms can explain these teacher characteristic effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Coenen","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Cornelisz","given":"Ilja"},{"family":"Groot","given":"Wim"},{"family":"Brink","given":"Henriette Maassen","dropping-particle":"van den"},{"family":"Klaveren","given":"Chris Van"}],"citation-key":"coenenTeacher2017","container-title":"Journal of Economic Surveys","DOI":"10.1111/joes.12210","ISSN":"1467-6419","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,18]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"1-30","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Teacher Characteristics and Their Effects on Student Test Scores: A Systematic Review","title-short":"Teacher Characteristics and Their Effects on Student Test Scores","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joes.12210","volume":"0"},

The setting included academic medical centers and clinical practices. Participants were patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 18 to 55 years old with at least 1 relapse in the prior year and 1 to 15 gadolinium-enhancing brain magnetic resonance imaging lesions. They were randomized between December 7, 2011, and March 21, 2013. The last participant completed follow-up December 2, 2013.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 4.3:4.3:1 to receive generic glatiramer acetate (20 mg), brand glatiramer acetate (20 mg), or placebo by daily subcutaneous injection for 9 months.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the total number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions during months 7, 8, and 9. Additional end points included other magnetic resonance imaging parameters, annualized relapse rate, and Expanded Disability Status Scale score.

  {"id":"cominsSpatial1992","abstract":"1. We consider models for host--parasitoid interactions in spatially patchy environments, where in each generation specified fractions of the host and parasitoid subpopulations in each patch move to adjacent patches. In most previous work of this general kind, the movement is not localized in this way, but involves `global' mixing of the populations prior to dispersal. 2. A remarkable range of dynamical behaviour is exhibited by a mathematically explicit model with constant host reproductive rate, deterministically unstable local dynamics and dispersing hosts and parasitoids that only move to nearest-neighbour patches in a density-independent way. The density of the host and parasitoid subpopulations in a two-dimensional array of patches may exhibit complex patterns of spiral waves, spatial chaos, a so-called static `crystal lattice' pattern, or they may become extinct. The probability of extinction rises rapidly when the number of patches present decreases below some characteristic arena size which varies with the scale of the spatial dynamics. 3. The different types of spatial dynamics that are observed depends critically on the fractions of hosts and adult parasitoids that disperse in each generation from the patches in which they emerged. Low rates of host dispersal tend to lead to chaotic patterns unless this rate is very low and parasitoid dispersal rates very high, in which case `crystal lattice' patterns may occur. Intermediate to high rates of host dispersal tend to result in spiral patterns. The effect of varying host rates of increase, within-patch parasitism that is inherently stabilizing and random patch-to-patch variation are also discussed. 4. The results are relatively insensitive to the details of the interaction. Thus, a similar range of behaviour (spirals, chaos and crystal lattices) is discernible from a very general `cellular automaton' model in which only qualitative categories of patch densities are specified together with a very simple set of `transition rules'. The diffusive dispersal of the explicit model is parallelled by making the new state in each generation depend, not only on the current state of the given `cell', but also on the states of a specified set of neighbouring cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Comins","given":"H.N."},{"family":"Hassell","given":"M.P."},{"family":"May","given":"R.M."}],"citation-key":"cominsSpatial1992","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.2307/5627","ISSN":"0021-8790","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",10,1]]},"note":"ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Oct., 1992 / Copyright © 1992 British Ecological Society","page":"735-748","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Spatial Dynamics of Host--Parasitoid Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/5627","volume":"61"},

Furthermore, studying the dependence structure of the price increments shows that while their autocorrelation function decreases rapidly to zero, the correlation of their squares and absolute values shows a slow power law decay, indicating persistence in the scale of fluctuations, a property which can be related to the anomalous scaling of the kurtosis.

In order to study the influence of mutations, we introduce a model that mimics epidemic spreading with immunization and mutations. The model exhibits a line of continuous phase transitions and includes the general epidemic process (GEP) and directed percolation (DP) as special cases. Restricting to perfect immunization in two spatial dimensions we analyze the phase diagram and study the scaling behavior along the phase transition line as well as in the vicinity of the GEP point.

An important goal of early outbreak analysis is to obtain a reliable estimate for the basic reproduction number, R . Over the past few years, infectious disease epidemic processes have gained attention from the physics community. Much of the work to date, however, has focused on the analysis of an epidemic process in which the disease has already spread widely within a population; conversely, very little attention has been paid, in the physics literature or elsewhere, to formulating the initial phase of an outbreak. Careful analysis of this phase is especially important as it could provide policymakers with insight on how to effectively control an epidemic in its initial stage. We present a novel method, based on the principles of network theory, that enables us to obtain a reliable real-time estimate of the basic reproduction number at an early stage of an outbreak. Our method takes into account the possibility that the infectious period has a wide distribution and that the degree distribution of the underlying contact network is heterogeneous.

  {"id":"dawkinsSelfish1989","abstract":"Richard Dawkins' brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare distinction of having provoked as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as within it. His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life. In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature. Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk. This revised edition of Dawkins' fascinating book contains two new chapters. One, entitled \"Nice Guys Finish First,\" demonstrates how cooperation can evolve even in a basically selfish world. The other new chapter, entitled \"The Long Reach of the Gene,\" which reflects the arguments presented in Dawkins' The Extended Phenotype, clarifies the startling view that genes may reach outside the bodies in which they dwell and manipulate other individuals and even the world at large. Containing a wealth of remarkable new insights into the biological world, the second edition once again drives home the fact that truth is stranger than fiction.","author":[{"family":"Dawkins","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"dawkinsSelfish1989","ISBN":"978-0-19-286092-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"372","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The selfish gene","type":"book"},

To investigate the algorithms and incentives that can be used in crowdsourcing quality evaluations, we built CrowdGrader, a tool that lets students submit and collaboratively grade solutions to homework assignments. We present the algorithms and techniques used in CrowdGrader, and we describe our results and experience in using the tool for several computer-science assignments. CrowdGrader combines the student-provided grades into a consensus grade for each submission using a novel crowdsourcing algorithm that relies on a reputation system. The algorithm iterativerly refines inter-dependent estimates of the consensus grades, and of the grading accuracy of each student. On synthetic data, the algorithm performs better than alternatives not based on reputation. On our preliminary experimental data, the performance seems dependent on the nature of review errors, with errors that can be ascribed to the reviewer being more tractable than those arising from random external events. To provide an incentive for reviewers, the grade each student receives in an assignment is a combination of the consensus grade received by their submissions, and of a reviewing grade capturing their reviewing effort and accuracy. This incentive worked well in practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Alfaro","given":"Luca","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Shavlovsky","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"dealfaroCrowdGrader2013","genre":"arXiv e-print","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,23]]},"number":"1308.5273","source":"arXiv.org","title":"CrowdGrader: Crowdsourcing the Evaluation of Homework Assignments","title-short":"CrowdGrader","type":"report","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5273"},

  {"id":"deoliveiraWhy2001","abstract":"The long-term behaviour of dynamic systems can be classified in two different regimes, regular or chaotic, depending on the values of the control parameters, which are kept constant during the time evolution. Starting from slightly different initial conditions, a regular system converges to the same final trajectory, whereas a chaotic system follows two distinct trajectories exponentially diverging from each other. In spite of these differences, regular and chaotic systems share a common property: both arrive exponentially fast to their final destiny, becoming trapped there. In both cases one has finite transient times. This is not a profitable property in what concerns evolutionary strategies, where the eternal search for new forms, better than the current one, is imperative. That is why evolutionary dynamic systems tend to tune themselves in very particular situations in between regular and chaotic regimes. These particular situations present eternal transients, and the system actually never reaches its final destiny, preserving diversity. This feature allows the system to visit other regions of the space of possibilities, not only the tiny region covered by its final attractor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Paulo Murilo Castro","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"deoliveiraWhy2001","container-title":"arXiv:cond-mat/0101170","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",1,11]]},"note":"Theory in Biosciences 120(1) (2001)","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Why do Evolutionary Systems Stick to the Edge of Chaos","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0101170"},

  {"id":"deslauriersMeasuring2019","abstract":"We compared students’ self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students’ perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods. For instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest that when students experience the increased cognitive effort associated with active learning, they initially take that effort to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a detrimental effect on students’ motivation, engagement, and ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to improve students’ response to being actively engaged in the classroom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Deslauriers","given":"Louis"},{"family":"McCarty","given":"Logan S."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Callaghan","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Kestin","given":"Greg"}],"citation-key":"deslauriersMeasuring2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1821936116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,4]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Sandpile models are found to exhibit criticality only when a pair of relevant parameters — dissipation ε and driving field h — are set to their critical values. The critical values of ε and h are both equal to zero. The first result is due to the absence of saturation (no bound on energy) in the sandpile model, while the second result is common to other absorbing-state transitions. The original definition of the sandpile model places it at the point (ε=0,h=0+): it is critical by definition. We argue power-law avalanche distributions are a general feature of models with infinitely many absorbing configurations, when they are subject to slow driving at the critical point. Our assertions are supported by simulations of the sandpile at ε=h=0 and fixed energy density ζ (no drive, periodic boundaries), and of the slowly driven pair contact process. We formulate a field theory for the sandpile model, in which the order parameter is coupled to a conserved energy density, which plays the role of an effective creation rate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Dickman","given":"Ronald"},{"family":"Vespignani","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Zapperi","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"dickmanSelforganized1998","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

The next-generation matrix (NGM) is the natural basis for the definition and calculation of ℛ0 where finitely many different categories of individuals are recognized. We clear up confusion that has been around in the literature concerning the construction of this matrix, specifically for the most frequently used so-called compartmental models. We present a detailed easy recipe for the construction of the NGM from basic ingredients derived directly from the specifications of the model. We show that two related matrices exist which we define to be the NGM with large domain and the NGM with small domain. The three matrices together reflect the range of possibilities encountered in the literature for the characterization of ℛ0. We show how they are connected and how their construction follows from the basic model ingredients, and establish that they have the same non-zero eigenvalues, the largest of which is the basic reproduction number ℛ0. Although we present formal recipes based on linear algebra, we encourage the construction of the NGM by way of direct epidemiological reasoning, using the clear interpretation of the elements of the NGM and of the model ingredients. We present a selection of examples as a practical guide to our methods. In the appendix we present an elementary but complete proof that ℛ0 defined as the dominant eigenvalue of the NGM for compartmental systems and the Malthusian parameter r, the real-time exponential growth rate in the early phase of an outbreak, are connected by the properties that ℛ0 > 1 if and only if r > 0, and ℛ0 = 1 if and only if r = 0.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Diekmann","given":"O."},{"family":"Heesterbeek","given":"J.

It is of course undeniable that any method of reducing a complex data set to a single number will necessarily have certain limitations and introduce certain biases. However, in this paper we point out that the definition of the $h$-index actually suffers from something far deeper: a hidden mathematical incompleteness intrinsic to its definition. In particular, we point out that one critical step within the definition of $h$ has been missed until now, resulting in an index which only achieves its stated objectives under certain rather limited circumstances. For example, this incompleteness explains why the $h$-index ultimately has more utility in certain scientific subfields than others. In this paper, we expose the origin of this incompleteness and then also propose a method of completing the definition of $h$ in a way which remains close to its original guiding principle. As a result, this \"completed\" $h$ not only reduces to the usual $h$ in cases where the $h$-index already achieves its objectives, but also extends the validity of the $h$-index into situations where it currently does not.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Dienes","given":"Keith R."}],"citation-key":"dienesCompleting2014","container-title":"arXiv:1404.2603 [physics]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,9]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Completing $h$","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2603"},

  {"id":"doebeliEvolution1997","abstract":"We study the evolution of dispersal rates in a two patch metapopulation model. The local dynamics in each patch are given by difference equations, which, together with the rate of dispersal between the patches, determine the ecological dynamics of the metapopulation. We assume that phenotypes are given by their dispersal rate. The evolutionary dynamics in phenotype space are determined by invasion exponents, which describe whether a mutant can invade a given resident population. If the resident metapopulation is at a stable equilibrium, then selection on dispersal rates is neutral if the population sizes in the two patches are the same, while selection drives dispersal rates to zero if the local abundances are different. With non-equilibrium metapopulation dynamics, non-zero dispersal rates can be maintained by selection. In this case, and if the patches are ecologically identical, dispersal rates always evolve to values which induce synchronized metapopulation dynamics. If the patches are ecologically different, evolutionary branching into two coexisting dispersal phenotypes can be observed. Such branching can happen repeatedly, leading to polymorphisms with more than two phenotypes. If there is a cost to dispersal, evolutionary cycling in phenotype space can occur due to the dependence of selection pressures on the ecological attractor of the resident population, or because phenotypic branching alternates with the extinction of one of the branches. Our results extend those of Holt and McPeek (1996), and suggest that phenotypic branching is an important evolutionary process. This process may be relevant for sympatric speciation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Doebeli","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Ruxton","given":"Graeme D."}],"citation-key":"doebeliEvolution1997","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.2307/2410996","ISSN":"0014-3820","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",12,1]]},"note":"ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Dec., 1997 / Copyright © 1997 Society for the Study of Evolution","page":"1730-1741","source":"JSTOR","title":"Evolution of Dispersal Rates in Metapopulation Models: Branching and Cyclic Dynamics in Phenotype Space","title-short":"Evolution of Dispersal Rates in Metapopulation Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2410996","volume":"51"},
  {"id":"doebeliMetapopulation2003","abstract":"Stepping-stone models for the ecological dynamics of metapopulations are often used to address general questions about the effects of spatial structure on the nature and complexity of population fluctuations. Such models describe an ensemble of local and spatially isolated habitat patches that are connected through dispersal. Reproduction and hence the dynamics in a given local population depend on the density of that local population, and a fraction of every local population disperses to neighboring patches. In such models, interesting dynamic phenomena, e.g. the persistence of locally unstable predator–prey interactions, are only observed if the local dynamics in an isolated patch exhibit non-equilibrium behavior. Therefore, the scope of these models is limited. Here we extend these models by making the biologically plausible assumption that reproductive success in a given local habitat not only depends on the density of the local population living in that habitat, but also on the densities of neighboring local populations. This would occur if competition for resources occurs between neighboring populations, e.g. due to foraging in neighboring habitats. With this assumption of quasi-local competition the dynamics of the model change completely. The main difference is that even if the dynamics of the local populations have a stable equilibrium in isolation, the spatially uniform equilibrium in which all local populations are at their carrying capacity becomes unstable if the strength of quasi-local competition reaches a critical level, which can be calculated analytically. In this case the metapopulation reaches a new stable state, which is, however, not spatially uniform anymore and instead results in an irregular spatial pattern of local population abundance. For large metapopulations, a huge number of different, spatially non-uniform equilibrium states coexist as attractors of the metapopulation dynamics, so that the final state of the system depends critically on the initial conditions. The existence of a large number of attractors has important consequences when environmental noise is introduced into the model. Then the metapopulation performs a random walk in the space of all attractors. This leads to large and complicated population fluctuations whose power spectrum obeys a red-shifted power law. Our theory reiterates the potential importance of spatial structure for ecological processes and proposes new mechanisms for the emergence of non-uniform spatial patterns of abundance and for the persistence of complicated temporal population fluctuations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Doebeli","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Killingback","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"doebeliMetapopulation2003","container-title":"Theoretical Population Biology","DOI":"10.1016/S0040-5809(03)00106-0","ISSN":"0040-5809","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",12]]},"page":"397-416","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Metapopulation dynamics with quasi-local competition","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580903001060","volume":"64"},
  {"id":"doebeliMultimodal2007","abstract":"During bouts of evolutionary diversification, such as adaptive radiations, the emerging species cluster around different locations in phenotype space. How such multimodal patterns in phenotype space can emerge from a single ancestral species is a fundamental question in biology. Frequency-dependent competition is one potential mechanism for such pattern formation, as has previously been shown in models based on the theory of adaptive dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that also in models similar to those used in quantitative genetics, phenotype distributions can split into multiple modes under the force of frequency-dependent competition. In sexual populations, this requires assortative mating, and we show that the multimodal splitting of initially unimodal distributions occurs over a range of assortment parameters. In addition, assortative mating can be favoured evolutionarily even if it incurs costs, because it provides a means of alleviating the effects of frequency dependence. Our results reveal that models at both ends of the spectrum between essentially monomorphic (adaptive dynamics) and fully polymorphic (quantitative genetics) yield similar results. This underscores that frequency-dependent selection is a strong agent of pattern formation in phenotype distributions, potentially resulting in adaptive speciation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Doebeli","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Blok","given":"Hendrik J.

  {"id":"doebeliPerspectives2016","abstract":"Most evolutionary theory is based on the notion of fitness. Fitness landscapes are in every evolutionist’s mind, and asserting that one type is fitter than another is commonplace. At the same time, it is rarely made clear what fitness actually is. Fitness is a somewhat vague concept that owes its prominence at least in part to an intuitively appealing, but fundamentally questionable teleological perspective of evolution. We think that fitness should not be a basal ingredient in verbal or mathematical descriptions of evolution. Instead, we propose that evolutionary birth-death processes, in which individuals give birth and die at ever-changing rates, should be the basis of evolutionary theory. Such processes capture the fundamental events that ultimately generate evolutionary dynamics. These dynamics can be complicated, because birth and death rates depend on the state of the evolving system, which changes as evolution unfolds, and because birth events involve the genetic details of offspring production. In evolutionary birth-death processes, fitness is at best a derived quantity, and in general there is no guarantee that there is a scalar quantity, such as fitness, that would describe long-term evolutionary outcomes. We discuss how evolutionary birth-death processes can provide useful perspectives on central issues such as the relationship between ecology and evolution, social evolution, multi-level selection, and cultural evolution.","author":[{"family":"Doebeli","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Ispolatov","given":"Iaroslav"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Burton"}],"citation-key":"doebeliPerspectives2016","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,15]]},"number-of-pages":"33","title":"Some perspectives on evolutionary theory","type":"manuscript"},

  {"id":"doolittleIt2016","abstract":"That holobionts (microbial communities and their animal or plant hosts) are units of selection squares poorly with the observation that microbes are often recruited (horizontally acquired) from the environment, not passed down vertically from parent to offspring, as required for collective reproduction. The taxonomic makeup of a holobiont’s microbial community may vary over its lifetime and differ from that of conspecifics. In contrast, biochemical functions of the microbiota and contributions to host biology are more conserved, with taxonomically variable but functionally similar microbes recurring across generations and hosts. To save what is of interest in holobiont thinking, we propose casting metabolic and developmental interaction patterns, rather than the taxa responsible for them, as units of selection. Such units need not directly reproduce or form parent-offspring lineages: their prior existence has created the conditions under which taxa with the genes necessary to carry out their steps have evolved in large numbers. These taxa or genes will reconstruct the original interaction patterns when favorable conditions occur. Interaction patterns will vary (for instance by the alteration or addition of intermediates) in ways that affect the likelihood of and circumstances under which such reconstruction occurs. Thus, they vary in fitness, and evolution by natural selection will occur at this level. It is on the persistence, reconstruction, and spread of such interaction patterns that students of holobiosis should concentrate, we suggest. This model also addresses other multi-species collectively beneficial interactions, such as biofilms or biogeochemical cycles maintaining all life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Doolittle","given":"W.

Conservation corridors may achieve this goal by facilitating movement among isolated patches, but there is a risk that increased connectivity could synchronize local population fluctuations (causing coherent oscillations) and thereby increase the danger of global extinction. We identify general conditions under which populations can or cannot undergo coherent oscillations, and we relate these conditions to local and global extinction probabilities. We suggest a simple method to explore the potential success of conservation corridors and, more generally, any manipulations of dispersal patterns that aim to protect threatened species or control pests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Earn","given":"David J.

  {"id":"ebelEvolutionary2002","abstract":"The emergence of complex networks from evolutionary games is studied occurring when agents are allowed to switch interaction partners. For this purpose a coevolutionary iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game is defined on a random network with agents as nodes and games along the links. The agents change their neighborhoods to improve their payoff. The system relaxes to stationary states corresponding to cooperative Nash equilibria with the additional property that no agent can improve its payoff by changing its neighborhood. Small perturbations of the system lead to avalanches of strategy readjustments reestablishing equilibrium. As a result of the dynamics, the network of interactions develops non-trivial topological properties as a broad degree distribution suggesting scale-free behavior, small-world characteristics, and assortative mixing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Ebel","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Bornholdt","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"ebelEvolutionary2002","container-title":"arXiv:cond-mat/0211666","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",11,28]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Evolutionary games and the emergence of complex networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0211666"},

We specialize to those markets, such interdealer broker markets, which are dominated by professional traders, who trade mainly through limit orders, watch markets closely, and move their limit order prices frequently. We model these markets as a set of buyers and a set of sellers diffusing in price space and interacting through an annihilation interaction. We seek to compute the purely statistical effects of the presence of large numbers of traders, as scaling laws on various measures of liquidity, and to this end we allow our model very few parameters. We find that the bid-offer spread scales as $\\sqrt{1/{\\rm Deal Rate}}$.In addition we investigate the scaling of other intuitive relationships, such as the relation between fluctuations of the best bid/offer and the density of buyers/sellers. We then study this model and its scaling laws under the influence of random disturbances to trader drift, trader volatility, and entrance rate. We also study possible extensions to the model, such as the addition of market order traders, and an interaction that models momentum-type trading. Finally, we discuss how detailed simulations may be carried out to study scaling in all of these settings, and how the models may be tested inactual markets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Eliezer","given":"David"},{"family":"Kogan","given":"Ian I"}],"citation-key":"eliezerScaling1998","container-title":"arXiv:cond-mat/9808240","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",8,21]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Scaling Laws for the Market Microstructure of the Interdealer Broker Markets","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9808240"},

In this article, hypothetical examples are used to illustrate the scope, purpose and methodology of this theory. The examples also demonstrate the way in which even partial multiple steady-state data provide a basis for highly refined discrimination between very similar mechanisms. In a companion article, actual multiple steady-state data are used to discriminate between proposed mechanisms for ethylene hydrogenation on rhodium.

Details for smaller regions have been obtained for 1821-1934 or 1937. The regions have been constructed from the original fur trade districts, in such a way as to give fairly standard areas for comparing catches over long periods. 2. The cycle in lynx furs is very violent and regular and has persisted unchanged for the whole period. Its average period is about 9.6 years. 3. This cycle is a real one in lynx populations, which are dependent upon the snowshoe rabbit (Lepus americanus) for food, and which starve when the rabbits disappear periodically. It is therefore strong evidence of a similar cycle in snowshoe rabbits for the last 206 years. 4. The wide synchronization of the cycle in different parts of Canada for at least 100 years, its parallel occurrence both west and east of the Rockies, and its independent occurrence in aquatic species such as the muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) and the salmon (Salmo salar), strongly suggest the existence of a climatic factor partly controlling it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,21]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Elton","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Nicholson","given":"Mary"}],"citation-key":"eltonTenYear1942","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.2307/1358","ISSN":"0021-8790","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1942"]]},"page":"215-244","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Ten-Year Cycle in Numbers of the Lynx in Canada","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1358","volume":"11"},

The basic idea is to use an outer SSA to simulate the slow processes with rates computed from an inner SSA which simulates the fast reactions. Averaging theorems for Markov processes can be used to identify the fast and slow variables in the system as well as the effective dynamics over the slow time scale, even though the algorithm itself does not rely on such information. This nested SSA can be easily generalized to systems with more than two separated time scales. Convergence and efficiency of the algorithm are discussed using the established error estimates and illustrated through examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"E","given":"Weinan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Di"},{"family":"Vanden-Eijnden","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"eNested2005","container-title":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.2109987","ISSN":"0021-9606, 1089-7690","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",11,14]]},"page":"194107","source":"scitation.aip.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca","title":"Nested stochastic simulation algorithm for chemical kinetic systems with disparate rates","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://scitation.aip.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/content/aip/journal/jcp/123/19/10.1063/1.2109987","volume":"123"},

The origin of the GFP is shown to be rooted in positive correlations between degree and characteristics. As a fruitful application of the GFP, we suggest effective and efficient sampling methods for identifying high characteristic nodes in large-scale networks.

  {"id":"farmerMarket2002","abstract":"Markets have internal dynamics leading to excess volatility and other phenomena that are difficult to explain using rational expectations models. This paper studies these using a nonequilibrium price formation rule, developed in the context of trading with market orders. Because this is so much simpler than a standard inter‐temporal equilibrium model, it is possible to study multi‐period markets analytically. The resulting price dynamics have second‐order oscillatory terms. Value investing does not necessarily cause prices to track values. Trend following causes short‐term trends in prices, but also causes longer‐term oscillations. When value investing and trend following are combined, even though there is little linear structure, there can be boom–bust cycles, excess and temporally correlated volatility, and fat tails in price fluctuations. The long‐term evolution of markets can be studied in terms of flows of money. Profits can be decomposed in terms of aggregate pairwise correlations. Under reinvestment of profits this leads to a capital allocation model that is equivalent to a standard model in population biology. An investigation of market efficiency shows that patterns created by trend followers are more resistant to efficiency than those created by value investors, and that profit maximizing behavior slows the progression to efficiency. Order of magnitude estimates suggest that the timescale for efficiency is years to decades.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Farmer","given":"J.

Unlike other introductory books, it focuses on the program design process, presenting program design guidelines that show the reader how to analyze a problem statement, how to formulate concise goals, how to make up examples, how to develop an outline of the solution, how to finish the program, and how to test it. Because learning to design programs is about the study of principles and the acquisition of transferable skills, the text does not use an off-the-shelf industrial language but presents a tailor-made teaching language. For the same reason, it offers DrRacket, a programming environment for novices that supports playful, feedback-oriented learning. The environment grows with readers as they master the material in the book until it supports a full-fledged language for the whole spectrum of programming tasks.This second edition has been completely revised. While the book continues to teach a systematic approach to program design, the second edition introduces different design recipes for interactive programs with graphical interfaces and batch programs. It also enriches its design recipes for functions with numerous new hints.

We show by that such explicit models often yield significantly different equilibrium distributions and transition times as compared to DDEs with deterministic delay values. Additionally, different explicit models with qualitatively different dynamics can give rise to the same DDEs revealing important ambiguities.

It is often the case, however, that discrete-time approaches are employed to analyze such models or to simulate them numerically. In such cases, time is discretized into uniform steps and transition rates between states are replaced by transition probabilities. In this paper, we illustrate potential limitations to this approach. We show how discretizing time leads to a restriction on the values of the model parameters that can accurately be studied. We examine numerical simulation schemes employed in the literature, showing how synchronous-type updating schemes can bias discrete-time formalisms when compared against continuous-time formalisms. Event-based simulations, such as the Gillespie algorithm, are proposed as optimal simulation schemes both in terms of replicating the continuous-time process and computational speed. Finally, we show how discretizing time can affect the value of the epidemic threshold for large values of the infection rate and the recovery rate, even if the ratio between the former and the latter is small.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Fennell","given":"Peter G."},{"family":"Melnik","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Gleeson","given":"James P."}],"citation-key":"fennellLimitations2016","container-title":"arXiv:1603.01132 [cond-mat, physics:physics]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,22]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"The limitations of discrete-time approaches to continuous-time contagion dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01132"},

Rather than an essay on the most significant achievements in modern science, The Character of Physical Law is a statement of what is most remarkable in nature. Feynman's enlightened approach, his wit, and his enthusiasm make this a memorable exposition of the scientist's craft. The Law of Gravitation is the author's principal example. Relating the details of its discovery and stressing its mathematical character, he uses it to demonstrate the essential interaction of mathematics and physics. He views mathematics as the key to any system of scientific laws, suggesting that if it were possible to fill out the structure of scientific theory completely, the result would be an integrated set of mathematical axioms. The principles of conservation, symmetry, and time-irreversibility are then considered in relation to developments in classical and modern physics, and in his final lecture Feynman develops his own analysis of the process and future of scientific discovery.

From this model we analytically calculate population growth rate (fitness) for sleeping and non-sleeping strategies.

This is a gem of a book that every college teacher should read.\" —Ken Bain, author, What the Best College Students Do Since the original publication of L. Dee Fink's Creating Significant Learning Experiences, higher education has continued to move in two opposite directions: more institutions encourage faculty to focus on research, obtaining grants, and publishing, while accreditation agencies, policy-makers, and students themselves emphasize the need for greater attention to the quality of teaching and learning. Now the author has updated his bestselling classic, providing busy faculty with invaluable conceptual and procedural tools for instructional design. Step by step, Fink shows how to use a taxonomy of significant learning and systematically combine the best research-based practices for learning-centered teaching with a teaching strategy in a way that results in powerful learning experiences. This edition addresses new research on how people learn, active learning, and student engagement; includes illustrative examples from online teaching; and reports on the effectiveness of Fink's time-tested model. Fink also explores recent changes in higher education nationally and internationally and offers more proven strategies for dealing with student resistance to innovative teaching. Tapping into the knowledge, tools, and strategies in Creating Significant Learning Experiences empowers educators to creatively design courses that will result in significant learning for their students. \"As thought-provoking and inspiring today as it was when it was first published, it is a 'must' for anyone serious about creating courses that challenge students to learn deeply.\" —Elizabeth F.

Previous experiments have indicated that under more realistic conditions of finite populations and stochastic payoffs, populations may evolve in trajectories that are unrelated to an ESS, even in very simple evolutionary games. The simulations are extended here to small populations with varying levels of selection pressure and mixing levels.

Depending on the payoff matrix, the systems self-organizes - after a transient - into stationary states characterized by their average probability of cooperation $\\bar{p}_{eq}$ and average equilibrium per-capita-income $\\bar{p}_{eq},\\bar{U}_\\infty$.

  {"id":"frankNatural2012","abstract":"The Price equation partitions total evolutionary change into two components. The first component provides an abstract expression of natural selection. The second component subsumes all other evolutionary processes, including changes during transmission. The natural selection component is often used in applications. Those applications attract widespread interest for their simplicity of expression and ease of interpretation. Those same applications attract widespread criticism by dropping the second component of evolutionary change and by leaving unspecified the detailed assumptions needed for a complete study of dynamics. Controversies over approximation and dynamics have nothing to do with the Price equation itself, which is simply a mathematical equivalence relation for total evolutionary change expressed in an alternative form. Disagreements about approach have to do with the tension between the relative valuation of abstract versus concrete analyses. The Price equation's greatest value has been on the abstract side, particularly the invariance relations that illuminate the understanding of natural selection. Those abstract insights lay the foundation for applications in terms of kin selection, information theory interpretations of natural selection and partitions of causes by path analysis.

Fisher's fundamental theorem emphasizes the variance in fitness. Quantitative genetics expresses selection with covariances and regressions. Population genetic equations depend on genetic variances. How can we read those statistical expressions with respect to the meaning of natural selection? One possibility is to relate the statistical expressions to the amount of information that populations accumulate by selection. However, the connection between selection and information theory has never been compelling. Here, I show the correct relations between statistical expressions for selection and information theory expressions for selection. Those relations link selection to the fundamental concepts of entropy and information in the theories of physics, statistics, and communication. We can now read the equations of selection in terms of their natural meaning.

The first PBD algorithm couples BD simulations with PDEs by randomly creating new particles close to the interface which partitions the domain and by reincorporating particles into the continuum PDE-description when they cross the interface. The second PBD algorithm introduces an overlap region, where both descriptions exist in parallel.

A rock beats a pair of scissors, scissors beat a sheet of paper and paper beats a rock, so the strategies form a competitive cycle. Although cycles in competitive ability appear to be reasonably rare among terrestrial plants, they are common among marine sessile organisms and have been reported in other contexts. Here we consider a system with three species in a competitive loop and show that this simple ecology exhibits two counter–intuitive phenomena. First, the species that is least competitive is expected to have the largest population and, where there are oscillations in a finite population, to be the least likely to die out. As a consequence an apparent weakening of a species leads to an increase in its population. Second, evolution favours the most competitive individuals within a species, which leads to a decline in its population. This is analogous to the tragedy of the commons, but here, rather than leading to a collapse, the ‘tragedy’ acts to maintain diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Frean","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Abraham","given":"Edward R"}],"citation-key":"freanRockscissorspaper2001","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Freeman","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Eddy","given":"Sarah L."},{"family":"McDonough","given":"Miles"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Michelle K."},{"family":"Okoroafor","given":"Nnadozie"},{"family":"Jordt","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Wenderoth","given":"Mary Pat"}],"citation-key":"freemanActive2014","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1319030111","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,10]]},"language":"en","license":"©  .

Here, we present long-term measurements of population dynamics using replicate digital holographic microscopes that maintain CES under precisely controlled external conditions while automatically measuring abundances of three microbial species via single-cell imaging. With this system, we measure spatiotemporal population dynamics in more than 60 replicate CES over periods of months. In contrast to previous studies, we observe strongly deterministic population dynamics in replicate systems. Furthermore, we show that previously discovered statistical structure in abundance fluctuations across replicate CES is driven by variation in external conditions, such as illumination. In particular, we confirm the existence of stable ecomodes governing the correlations in population abundances of three species. The observation of strongly deterministic dynamics, together with stable structure of correlations in response to external perturbations, points towards a possibility of simple macroscopic laws governing microbial systems despite numerous stochastic events present on microscopic levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Frentz","given":"Zak"},{"family":"Kuehn","given":"Seppe"},{"family":"Leibler","given":"Stanislas"}],"citation-key":"frentzStrongly2015","container-title":"Physical Review X","container-title-short":"Phys.

  {"id":"friesenExperimental2004","abstract":"Abstract We investigate adaptive diversification in experimental Escherichia coli populations grown in serial batch cultures on a mixture of glucose and acetate. All 12 experimental lines were started from the same genetically uniform ancestral strain but became highly polymorphic for colony size after 1000 generations. Five populations were clearly dimorphic and thus serve as a model for an adaptive lineage split. We analyzed the ecological basis for this dimorphism by studying bacterial growth curves. All strains exhibit diauxie, that is, sequential growth on the two resources. Thus, they exhibit phenotypic plasticity, using mostly glucose when glucose is abundant, then switching to acetate when glucose concentration is low. However, the coexisting strains differ in their diauxie pattern, with one cluster in the dimorphic populations growing better in the glucose phase, and the other cluster having a much shorter lag when switching to the acetate phase. Using invasion experiments, we show that the dimorphism of these two ecological types is maintained by frequency-dependent selection. Using a mathematical model for the adaptive dynamics of diauxie behavior, we show that evolutionary branching in diauxie behavior is a plausible theoretical scenario. Our results support the hypothesis that, in our experiments, adaptive diversification from a genetically uniform ancestor occurred due to frequency-dependent ecological interactions. Our results have implications for understanding the evolution of cross-feeding polymorphism in microorganisms, as well as adaptive speciation due to frequency-dependent selection on phenotypic plasticity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Friesen","given":"Maren L"},{"family":"Saxer","given":"Gerda"},{"family":"Travisano","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Doebeli","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"friesenExperimental2004","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb01642.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"245-260","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Experimental Evidence for Sympatric Ecological Diversification Due to Frequency‐dependent Competition in Escherichia Coli","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb01642.x/abstract","volume":"58"},

  {"id":"gaboraEvolutionary2012","abstract":"Dawkins' replicator-based conception of evolution has led to widespread mis-application selectionism across the social sciences because it does not address the paradox that inspired the theory of natural selection in the first place: how do organisms accumulate change when traits acquired over their lifetime are obliterated? This is addressed by von Neumann's concept of a self-replicating automaton (SRA). A SRA consists of a self-assembly code that is used in two distinct ways: (1) actively deciphered during development to construct a self-similar replicant, and (2) passively copied to the replicant to ensure that it can reproduce. Information that is acquired over a lifetime is not transmitted to offspring, whereas information that is inherited during copying is transmitted. In cultural evolution there is no mechanism for discarding acquired change. Acquired change can accumulate orders of magnitude faster than, and quickly overwhelm, inherited change due to differential replication of variants in response to selection. This prohibits a selectionist but not an evolutionary framework for culture. Recent work on the origin of life suggests that early life evolved through a non-Darwinian process referred to as communal exchange that does not involve a self-assembly code, and that natural selection emerged from this more haphazard, ancestral evolutionary process. It is proposed that communal exchange provides a more appropriate evolutionary framework for culture than selectionism. This is supported by a computational model of cultural evolution and a network-based program for documenting material cultural history, and it is consistent with high levels of human cooperation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Gabora","given":"Liane"}],"citation-key":"gaboraEvolutionary2012","container-title":"arXiv:1206.4386","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,20]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"An Evolutionary Framework for Culture: Selectionism versus Communal Exchange","title-short":"An Evolutionary Framework for Culture","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4386"},

Classical approaches, such as deterministic or stochastic approach, fail to account for or to exploit this multi-scale nature, respectively. In this paper, we propose a jump-diffusion approximation for multi-scale Markov jump processes that couples the two modeling approaches. An error bound of the proposed approximation is derived and used to partition the reactions into fast and slow sets, where the fast set is simulated by a stochastic differential equation and the slow set is modeled by a discrete chain. The error bound leads to a very efficient dynamic partitioning algorithm which has been implemented for several multi-scale reaction systems. The gain in computational efficiency is illustrated by a realistically sized model of a signal transduction cascade coupled to a gene expression dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Ganguly","given":"Arnab"},{"family":"Altintan","given":"Derya"},{"family":"Koeppl","given":"Heinz"}],"citation-key":"gangulyJumpDiffusion2014","container-title":"arXiv:1409.4303 [math, q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,15]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Jump-Diffusion Approximation of Stochastic Reaction Dynamics: Error bounds and Algorithms","title-short":"Jump-Diffusion Approximation of Stochastic Reaction Dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4303"},

Despite recent major improvements in the efficiency of the SSA, its drawback remains the great amount of computer time that is often required to simulate a desired amount of system time. Presented here is the “τ-leap” method, an approximate procedure that in some circumstances can produce significant gains in simulation speed with acceptable losses in accuracy. Some primitive strategies for control parameter selection and error mitigation for the τ-leap method are described, and simulation results for two simple model systems are exhibited. With further refinement, the τ-leap method should provide a viable way of segueing from the exact SSA to the approximate chemical Langevin equation, and thence to the conventional deterministic reaction rate equation, as the system size becomes larger.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gillespie","given":"Daniel T."}],"citation-key":"gillespieApproximate2001","container-title":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"doi:10.1063/1.1378322","ISSN":"00219606","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",7,22]]},"page":"1716-1733","source":"AIP","title":"Approximate accelerated stochastic simulation of chemically reacting systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jcp.aip.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/resource/1/jcpsa6/v115/i4/p1716_s1","volume":"115"},

Finally, we review some recent efforts to adapt and extend the discrete-stochastic approach to systems that are not well-mixed.

  {"id":"gimpelUnlocking2023","abstract":"Executive Summary Generative AI technologies, such as large language models, have the potential to revolutionize much of our higher education teaching and learning. ChatGPT is an impressive, easy-to-use, publicly accessible system demonstrating the power of large language models such as GPT-4. Other comparable generative models are available for text processing, images, audio, video, and other outputs-and we expect a massive further performance increase, integration in larger software systems, and diffusion in the coming years. This technological development triggers substantial uncertainty and change in university-level teaching and learning. Students ask questions like: How can ChatGPT or other artificial intelligence tools support me? Am I allowed to use ChatGPT for a seminar or final paper, or is that cheating? How exactly do I use ChatGPT best? Are there other ways to access models such as GPT-4? Given that such tools are here to stay, what skills should I acquire, and what is obsolete? Lecturers ask similar questions from a different perspective: What skills should I teach? How can I test students' competencies rather than their ability to prompt generative AI models? How can I use ChatGPT and other systems based on generative AI to increase my efficiency or even improve my students' learning experience and outcomes? Even if the current discussion revolves around ChatGPT and GPT-4, these are only the forerunners of what we can expect from future generative AI-based models and tools. So even if you think ChatGPT is not yet technically mature, it is worth looking into its impact on higher education. This is where this whitepaper comes in. It looks at ChatGPT as a contemporary example of a conversational user interface that leverages large language models. The whitepaper looks at ChatGPT from the perspective of students and lecturers. It focuses on everyday areas of higher education: teaching courses, learning for an exam, crafting seminar papers and theses, and assessing students' learning outcomes and performance. For this purpose, we consider the chances and concrete application possibilities, the limits and risks of ChatGPT, and the underlying large language models. This serves two purposes: • First, we aim to provide concrete examples and guidance for individual students and lecturers to find their way of dealing with ChatGPT and similar tools. • Second, this whitepaper shall inform the more extensive organizational sensemaking processes on embracing and enclosing large language models or related tools in higher education. We wrote this whitepaper based on our experience in information systems, computer science, management , and sociology. We have hands-on experience in using generative AI tools. As professors, postdocs, doctoral candidates, and students, we constantly innovate our teaching and learning. Fully embracing the chances and challenges of generative AI requires adding further perspectives from scholars in various other disciplines (focusing on didactics of higher education and legal aspects), university administrations, and broader student groups. Overall, we have a positive picture of generative AI models and tools such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT. As always, there is light and dark, and change is difficult. However, if we issue clear guidelines on the part of the universities, faculties, and individual lecturers, and if lecturers and students use such systems efficiently and responsibly, our higher education system may improve. We see a great chance for that if we embrace and manage the change appropriately.","author":[{"family":"Gimpel","given":"Henner"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Decker","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Eymann","given":"Torsten"},{"family":"Lämmermann","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Maedche","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Röglinger","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"Ruiner","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Schoch","given":"Manfred"},{"family":"Schoop","given":"Mareike"},{"family":"Urbach","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Vandirk","given":"Steffen"}],"citation-key":"gimpelUnlocking2023","DOI":"10.13140/RG.2.2.20710.09287/2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,20]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Unlocking the Power of Generative AI Models and Systems such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT for Higher Education A Guide for Students and Lecturers Unlocking the Power of Generative AI Models and Systems such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT for Higher Education A Guide for Students and Lecturers","type":"book"},

The mean serum 25-OH-D in the 13 cats with >5 TR was 131.2 +/- 49.5 nmol/L, which was significantly less than in cats with no TR (p < 0.05). There was no relationship between TR type and serum 25-OH-D. There was no effect of age or sex on serum 25-OH-D.

Employees decide whether or not to contribute to production based on their expectations as to how other employees will act. Trained workers learn over time and fold their increased productivity into their decision whether or not to contribute. We find that the dynamical behavior at the two levels is closely coupled: the evolution of the industry over time depends not only on the characteristics of training programs, learning curves, and cost-benefit analyses, but on the vagaries of chance as well. For example, in one case, the double dilemma can be resolved for the industry as a whole and productivity then increases steadily over time. In another, the organizational level dilemma may remain unresolved and workers may contribute at fluctuating levels. In this case the overall productivity stays low. We also find a correlation between high productivity and low turnover and show that a small increase in training rates can lead to explosive growth in productivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Glance","given":"Natalie S"},{"family":"Hogg","given":"Tad"},{"family":"Huberman","given":"Bernardo A"}],"citation-key":"glanceTraining1994","container-title":"arXiv:adap-org/9402001","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",2,8]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Training and Turnover in Organizations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/adap-org/9402001"},

From the empirical time series we obtain probability density functions of burst and inter-burst duration. Our analysis reveals that the power-law exponents of the obtained probability density functions are close to $3/2$, which is a characteristic feature of the one-dimensional stochastic processes.

  {"id":"goodfellowDeep2016","abstract":"\"Written by three experts in the field,  Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.\" -- Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.  Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

  {"id":"gorrelFeline2002","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to increase understanding of the factors initiating feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions (FORLs). Fifty-six teeth (clinically and radiographically unaffected by ORLs) were harvested. Of these, 43 were from cats that had ORLs in other teeth (group A) and 13 were from cats with no clinical or radiographic evidence of ORLs in any teeth (group B). Twenty-six teeth in group A and one tooth in group B showed histological evidence of external root resorption (surface resorption and replacement resorption resulting in ankylosis). Some teeth in group B showed healed cementum resorption. It has previously been assumed that FORLs were similar to lesions associated with peripheral inflammatory root resorption, and were associated with periodontal disease. These histological findings suggest instead that a FORL is a non-inflammatory replacement resorption, resulting in ankylosis. The periodontal ligament of resorbing teeth lacked normal fibrous architecture, but was not inflamed. Resorption was not identified in cervical cementum. However, the histological appearance of the cervical cementum differed between the two groups. Several aetiopathogenetic explanatory models which arise from these observations are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Gorrel","given":"C."},{"family":"Larsson","given":"Å"}],"citation-key":"gorrelFeline2002","container-title":"Journal of Small Animal Practice","DOI":"10.1111/j.1748-5827.2002.tb00018.x","ISSN":"1748-5827","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"482-488","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions: unveiling the early lesion","title-short":"Feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2002.tb00018.x","volume":"43"},

We show that the Snowdrift Game exhibits a pattern of behavior whose complexity grows as the cognitive levels of players increases. In addition to finding the solutions up to the third cognitive level, we demonstrate, in this theoretical frame, two new properties of snowdrift games: i) any snowdrift game can be characterized by only a parameter -- its class, ii) they are anti-symmetric with respect to the diagonal of the pay-off's space.

Sex retards local adaptation if antagonistic pleiotropy underlies trade-offs, but facilitates adaptation if mutation accumulation underlies trade-offs. We evaluate the effect of sex in heterogeneous environments by manipulating gene-flow between two niches in sexual and asexual populations using steady-state microcosm experiments with yeast. We find that only sex in the presence of gene-flow promotes simultaneous local adaptation to different niches, presumably as this exposes mutations neutrally accrued in alternate niches to selection. This finding aligns with work showing mutation accumulation underlies trade-offs to local adaptation in asexual microbes, and with inferences of divergence in the presence of gene-flow in natural sexual populations.

  {"id":"grimSpatialization1996","abstract":"The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma has become the standard model for the evolution of cooperative behavior within a community of egoistic agents, frequently cited for implications in both sociology and biology. Due primarily to the work of Axelrod (1980a, 1980b, 1984, 1985), a strategy of tit for tat (TFT) has established a reputation as being particularly robust. Nowak and Sigmund (1992) have shown, however, that in a world of stochastic error or imperfect communication, it is not TFT that finally triumphs in an ecological model based on population percentages (Axelrod and Hamilton 1981), but ‘generous tit for tat’ (GTFT), which repays cooperation with a probability of cooperation approaching 1 but forgives defection with a probability of 13. In this paper, we consider a spatialized instantiation of the stochastic Prisoner's Dilemma, using two-dimensional cellular automata (Wolfram, 1984, 1986; Gutowitz, 1990) to model the spatial dynamics of populations of competing strategies. The surprising result is that in the spatial model it is not GTFT but still more generous strategies that are favored.

  {"id":"gruenEfficacy2021","abstract":"Background: Pain management for cats with degenerative joint disease (DJD) remains a critical unmet need. Recent work has shown promise for a feline-specific anti-nerve growth factor monoclonal antibody (frunevetmab) to deliver safe and effective pain management. Our objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of frunevetmab administered twice using two administration routes (subcutaneous and intravenous) compared to placebo.Methods: This was a randomized placebo-controlled, double-masked study. After a week-long pain and activity baseline, 126 cats were randomized to receive injections of frunevetmab (IV then SC; n = 42 or SC then SC; n = 43) or placebo (IV then SC; n = 41) on Days 0 and 28. Owners completed questionnaires on Days 14, 28, 42, and 56. Accelerometry data were collected continuously throughout.Results: Owner questionnaire results showed significant improvement in frunevetmab-treated cats [compared to placebo; (p < 0.05)] at Days 42 and 56; no difference was found between routes of administration for frunevetmab. All groups had decreased objectively measured weekly activity from baseline; frunevetmab-treated cats had a mean decrease of 0.9%, while placebo-treated cats had a mean decrease of 9.3%. Treatments were generally well-tolerated. The majority of adverse events included dermatitis/alopecia related to activity-monitor collars; these occurred in a higher percentage of frunevetmab, compared to placebo, treated cats.Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Treatment with frunevetmab provided improvements in owner ratings of mobility over treatment with placebo; these results were supported by objectively measured accelerometry. Frunevetmab has the potential to address a critical gap in the treatment of chronic pain in cats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Gruen","given":"Margaret E."},{"family":"Myers","given":"Jamie A.

  {"id":"guanRole2019","abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and neuronal damage. Environmental and genetic factors are associated with the risk of developing MS, but the exact cause still remains unidentified. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), vitamin D, and smoking are among the most well-established environmental risk factors in MS. Infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by delayed primary EBV infection, increases the risk of developing MS. EBV may also contribute to MS pathogenesis indirectly by activating silent human endogenous retrovirus-W. The emerging B-cell depleting therapies, particularly anti-CD20 agents such as rituximab, ocrelizumab, as well as the fully human ofatumumab, have shown promising clinical and magnetic resonance imaging benefit. One potential effect of these therapies is the depletion of memory B-cells, the primary reservoir site where EBV latency occurs. In addition, EBV potentially interacts with both genetic and other environmental factors to increase susceptibility and disease severity of MS. This review examines the role of EBV in MS pathophysiology and summarizes the recent clinical and radiological findings, with a focus on B-cells and in vivo imaging. Addressing the potential link between EBV and MS allows the better understanding of MS pathogenesis and helps to identify additional disease biomarkers that may be responsive to B-cell depleting intervention.","author":[{"family":"Guan","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Jakimovski","given":"Dejan"},{"family":"Ramanathan","given":"Murali"},{"family":"Weinstock-Guttman","given":"Bianca"},{"family":"Zivadinov","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"guanRole2019","container-title":"Neural Regeneration Research","container-title-short":"Neural Regen Res","DOI":"10.4103/1673-5374.245462","ISSN":"1673-5374","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"373-386","PMCID":"PMC6334604","PMID":"30539801","source":"PubMed","title":"The role of Epstein-Barr virus in multiple sclerosis: from molecular pathophysiology to in vivo imaging","title-short":"The role of Epstein-Barr virus in multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

This leads to the possibility of creating smart matter, i.e., materials whose properties can be changed under program control to suit varying constraints. A key difficulty in realizing the potential of smart matter is developing the appropriate control programs. We present a market-based multiagent solution to the problem of maintaining a physical system near an unstable configuration, a particularly challenging application for smart matter. This market control leads to stability by focussing control forces in those parts of the system where they are most needed. Moreover, it does so even when some actuators fail to work and without requiring the agents to have a detailed model of the physical system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Guenther","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Hogg","given":"Tad"},{"family":"Huberman","given":"Bernardo A"}],"citation-key":"guentherPower1997","container-title":"arXiv:cond-mat/9703078","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",3,7]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Power Markets for Controlling Smart Matter","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9703078"},

  {"id":"gustafsonBeating2017","abstract":"A new data type called a posit is designed as a direct drop-in replacement for IEEE Standard 754 floating-point numbers (floats). Unlike earlier forms of universal number (unum) arithmetic, posits do not require interval arithmetic or variable size operands; like floats, they round if an answer is inexact. However, they provide compelling advantages over floats, including larger dynamic range, higher accuracy, better closure, bitwise identical results across systems, simpler hardware, and simpler exception handling. Posits never overflow to infinity or underflow to zero, and “Not-a-Number” (NaN) indicates an action instead of a bit pattern. A posit processing unit takes less circuitry than an IEEE float FPU. With lower power use and smaller silicon footprint, the posit operations per second (POPS) supported by a chip can be significantly higher than the FLOPS using similar hardware resources. GPU accelerators and Deep Learning processors, in particular, can do more per watt and per dollar with posits, yet deliver superior answer quality. A comprehensive series of benchmarks compares floats and posits for decimals of accuracy produced for a set precision. Low precision posits provide a better solution than “approximate computing” methods that try to tolerate decreased answer quality. High precision posits provide more correct decimals than floats of the same size; in some cases, a 32-bit posit may safely replace a 64-bit float. In other words, posits beat floats at their own game.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gustafson","given":"John L."},{"family":"Yonemoto","given":"Isaac T."}],"citation-key":"gustafsonBeating2017","container-title":"Supercomputing Frontiers and Innovations","DOI":"10.14529/jsfi170206","ISSN":"2313-8734","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,25]]},"language":"en","license":"Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution License  that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.","number":"2","page":"71-86-86","source":"www.superfri.org","title":"Beating Floating Point at its Own Game: Posit Arithmetic","title-short":"Beating Floating Point at its Own Game","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.superfri.org/superfri/article/view/137","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"gyoriProbabilistic2014","abstract":"The construction and formal verification of dynamical models is important in engineering, biology and other disciplines. We focus on non-linear models containing a set of parameters governing their dynamics. The value of these parameters is often unknown and not directly observable through measurements, which are themselves noisy. When treating parameters as random variables, one can constrain their distribution by conditioning on observations and thereby constructing a posterior probability distribution. We aim to perform model verification with respect to this posterior. The main difficulty in performing verification on a model under the posterior distribution is that in general, it is difficult to obtain \\emph{independent} samples from the posterior, especially for non-linear dynamical models. Standard statistical model checking methods require independent realizations of the system and are therefore not applicable in this context. We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo based statistical model checking framework, which produces a sequence of dependent random realizations of the model dynamics over the parameter posterior. Using this sequence of samples, we use statistical hypothesis tests to verify whether the model satisfies a bounded temporal logic property with a certain probability. We use sample size bounds tailored to the setting of dependent samples for fixed sample size and sequential tests. We apply our method to a case-study from the domain of systems biology, to a model of the JAK-STAT biochemical pathway. The pathway is modeled as a system of non-linear ODEs containing a set of unknown parameters. Noisy, indirect observations of the system state are available from an experiment. The results show that the proposed method enables probabilistic verification with respect to the parameter posterior with specified error bounds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Gyori","given":"Benjamin M."},{"family":"Paulin","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Palaniappan","given":"Sucheendra K."}],"citation-key":"gyoriProbabilistic2014","container-title":"arXiv:1411.0976 [cs, q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,4]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Probabilistic verification of partially observable dynamical systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0976"},

  {"id":"harwattSubstituting2017","abstract":"Shifting dietary patterns for environmental benefits has long been advocated. In relation to mitigating climate change, the debate has been more recent, with a growing interest from policy makers, academics, and society. Many researchers have highlighted the need for changes to food consumption in order to achieve the required greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. So far, food consumption has not been anchored in climate change policy to the same extent as energy production and usage, nor has it been considered within the context of achieving GHG targets to a level where tangible outputs are available. Here, we address those issues by performing a relatively simple analysis that considers the extent to which one food exchange could contribute to achieving GHG reduction targets in the United States (US). We use the targeted reduction for 2020 as a reference and apply published Life Cycle Assessment data on GHG emissions to beans and beef consumed in the US. We calculate the difference in GHGs resulting from the replacement of beef with beans in terms of both calories and protein. Our results demonstrate that substituting one food for another, beans for beef, could achieve approximately 46 to 74% of the reductions needed to meet the 2020 GHG target for the US. In turn, this shift would free up 42% of US cropland (692,918 km2). While not currently recognized as a climate policy option, the “beans for beef” scenario offers significant climate change mitigation and other environmental benefits, illustrating the high potential of animal to plant food shifts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Harwatt","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Sabaté","given":"Joan"},{"family":"Eshel","given":"Gidon"},{"family":"Soret","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Ripple","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"harwattSubstituting2017","container-title":"Climatic Change","container-title-short":"Climatic Change","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-017-1969-1","ISSN":"1573-1480","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"261-270","source":"Springer Link","title":"Substituting beans for beef as a contribution toward US climate change targets","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-1969-1","volume":"143"},

  {"id":"hattonPredatorprey2015","abstract":"A general scaling law for ecology\nDespite the huge diversity of ecological communities, they can have unexpected patterns in common. Hatton et al. describe a general scaling law that relates total predator and prey biomass in terrestrial and aquatic animal communities (see the Perspective by Cebrian). They draw on data from many thousands of population counts of animal communities ranging from plankton to large mammals, across a wide range of biomes. They find a ubiquitous pattern of biomass scaling, which may suggest an underlying organization in ecosystems. It seems that communities follow systematic changes in structure and dynamics across environmental gradients.\nScience, this issue 10.1126/science.aac6284; see also p. 1053\nStructured Abstract\nINTRODUCTION A surprisingly general pattern at very large scales casts light on the link between ecosystem structure and function. We show a robust scaling law that emerges uniquely at the level of whole ecosystems and is conserved across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. This pattern describes the changing structure and productivity of the predator-prey biomass pyramid, which represents the biomass of communities at different levels of the food chain. Scaling exponents of the relation between predator versus prey biomass and community production versus biomass are often near ¾, which indicates that very different communities of species exhibit similar high-level structure and function. This recurrent community growth pattern is remarkably similar to individual growth patterns and may hint at a basic process that reemerges across levels of organization.\nRATIONALE We assembled a global data set for community biomass and production across 2260 large mammal, invertebrate, plant, and plankton communities. These data reveal two ecosystem-level power law scaling relations: (i) predator biomass versus prey biomass, which indicates how the biomass pyramid changes shape, and (ii) community production versus community biomass, which indicates how per capita productivity changes at a given level in the pyramid. Both relations span a wide range of ecosystems along large-scale biomass gradients. These relations can be linked theoretically to show how pyramid shape depends on flux rates into and out of predator-prey communities. In order to link community-level patterns to individual processes, we examined community size structure and, particularly, how the mean body mass of a community relates to its biomass.\nRESULTS Across ecosystems globally, pyramid structure becomes consistently more bottom-heavy, and per capita production declines with increasing biomass. These two ecosystem-level patterns both follow power laws with near ¾ exponents and are shown to be robust to different methods and assumptions. These structural and functional relations are linked theoretically, suggesting that a common community-growth pattern influences predator-prey interactions and underpins pyramid shape. Several of these patterns are highly regular (R2 > 0.80) and yet are unexpected from classic theories or from empirical relations at the population or individual level. By examining community size structure, we show these patterns emerge distinctly at the ecosystem level and independently from individual near ¾ body-mass allometries.\nCONCLUSION Systematic changes in biomass and production across trophic communities link fundamental aspects of ecosystem structure and function. The striking similarities that are observed across different kinds of systems imply a process that does not depend on system details. The regularity of many of these relations allows large-scale predictions and suggests high-level organization. This community-level growth pattern suggests a systematic form of density-dependent growth and is intriguing given the parallels it exhibits to growth scaling at the individual level, both of which independently follow near ¾ exponents. Although we can make ecosystem-level predictions from individual-level data, we have yet to fully understand this similarity, which may offer insight into growth processes in physiology and ecology across the tree of life.

[Photo: Amaury Laporte]\nEcosystems exhibit surprising regularities in structure and function across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. We assembled a global data set for 2260 communities of large mammals, invertebrates, plants, and plankton. We find that predator and prey biomass follow a general scaling law with exponents consistently near ¾. This pervasive pattern implies that the structure of the biomass pyramid becomes increasingly bottom-heavy at higher biomass. Similar exponents are obtained for community production-biomass relations, suggesting conserved links between ecosystem structure and function. These exponents are similar to many body mass allometries, and yet ecosystem scaling emerges independently from individual-level scaling, which is not fully understood. These patterns suggest a greater degree of ecosystem-level organization than previously recognized and a more predictive approach to ecological theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Hatton","given":"Ian A."},{"family":"McCann","given":"Kevin S."},{"family":"Fryxell","given":"John M."},{"family":"Davies","given":"T.

  {"id":"hauertReplicator2002","abstract":"The public goods game represents a straightforward generalization of the prisoner's dilemma to an arbitrary number of players. Since the dominant strategy is to defect, both classical and evolutionary game theory predict the asocial outcome that no player contributes to the public goods. In contrast to the compulsory public goods game, optional participation provides a natural way to avoid deadlocks in the state of mutual defection. The three resulting strategies—collaboration or defection in the public goods game, as well as not joining at all—are studied by means of a replicator dynamics, which can be completely analysed in spite of the fact that the payoff terms are nonlinear. If cooperation is valuable enough, the dynamics exhibits a rock-scissors-paper type of cycling between the three strategies, leading to sizeable average levels of cooperation in the population. Thus, voluntary participation makes cooperation feasible. But for each strategy, the average payoff value remains equal to the earnings of those not participating in the public goods game.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Hauert","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Monte","given":"Silvia","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Hofbauer","given":"Josef"},{"family":"Sigmund","given":"Karl"}],"citation-key":"hauertReplicator2002","container-title":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","DOI":"10.1006/jtbi.2002.3067","ISSN":"0022-5193","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",9,21]]},"page":"187-194","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Replicator Dynamics for Optional Public Good Games","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519302930675","volume":"218"},
  {"id":"hauertVolunteering2002","abstract":"The evolution of cooperation among nonrelated individuals is one of the fundamental problems in biology and social sciences. Reciprocal altruism fails to provide a solution if interactions are not repeated often enough or groups are too large. Punishment and reward can be very effective but require that defectors can be traced and identified. Here we present a simple but effective mechanism operating under full anonymity. Optional participation can foil exploiters and overcome the social dilemma. In voluntary public goods interactions, cooperators and defectors will coexist. We show that this result holds under very diverse assumptions on population structure and adaptation mechanisms, leading usually not to an equilibrium but to an unending cycle of adjustments (a Red Queen type of evolution). Thus, voluntary participation offers an escape hatch out of some social traps. Cooperation can subsist in sizable groups even if interactions are not repeated, defectors remain anonymous, players have no memory, and assortment is purely random.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hauert","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Monte","given":"Silvia De"},{"family":"Hofbauer","given":"Josef"},{"family":"Sigmund","given":"Karl"}],"citation-key":"hauertVolunteering2002","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1070582","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"5570","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",10,5]]},"language":"en","page":"1129-1132","source":"www.sciencemag.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca","title":"Volunteering as Red Queen Mechanism for Cooperation in Public Goods Games","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/296/5570/1129","volume":"296"},

  {"id":"hebert-dufresneSourcesink2022","abstract":"Social change in any society entails changes in both behaviours and institutions. We model a group-structured society in which the transmission of individual behaviour occurs in parallel with the selection of group-level institutions. We consider a cooperative behaviour that generates collective benefits for groups but does not spread between individuals on its own. Groups exhibit institutions that increase the diffusion of the behaviour within the group, but also incur a group cost. Groups adopt institutions in proportion to their fitness. Finally, the behaviour may also spread globally. We find that behaviour and institutions can be mutually reinforcing. But the model also generates behavioural source-sink dynamics when behaviour generated in institutionalized groups spreads to non-institutionalized groups and boosts their fitness. Consequently, the global diffusion of group-beneficial behaviour creates a pattern of institutional free-riding that limits the evolution of group-beneficial institutions. Our model suggests that, in a group-structured society, large-scale beneficial social change can be best achieved when the relevant behaviour and institutions remain correlated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Hébert-Dufresne","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Waring","given":"Timothy M."},{"family":"St-Onge","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Niles","given":"Meredith T."},{"family":"Kati Corlew","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Dube","given":"Matthew P."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Stephanie J."},{"family":"Gotelli","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"McGill","given":"Brian J."}],"citation-key":"hebert-dufresneSourcesink2022","container-title":"Royal Society Open Science","DOI":"10.1098/rsos.211743","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,22]]},"page":"211743","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing-org.eu1.proxy.openathens.net (Atypon)","title":"Source-sink behavioural dynamics limit institutional evolution in a group-structured society","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing-org.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/doi/10.1098/rsos.211743","volume":"9"},

Some analysts employ the Prisoner's Dilemma paradigm, other analysts suggest that different social dilemmas underlie collective action, and still others deny that social dilemmas play any significant role in collective action. I propose a theoretically exhaustive inventory of the dilemmas arising in collective action systems and show that five games, including the Prisoner's Dilemma, can underlie collective action. To analyze action within each game I use a dynamic selectionist model based on three modes of organization--voluntary cooperation, strategic interaction, and selective incentives. Social dilemmas exist in four of the five games, and conflicting accounts of collective action have focused on different games and modes of organization. As collective action proceeds from initiation to rapid expansion to stability, its game type varies in a way that can be precisely characterized as movement through a two-dimensional game-space. Finally, I distinguish between two ways of promoting collective action: One way focuses on resolving the dilemma within a particular game; the other focuses on changing the game so the dilemma is more easily resolved or eliminated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Heckathorn","given":"Douglas D."}],"citation-key":"heckathornDynamics1996","container-title":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.2307/2096334","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",4,1]]},"note":"ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Apr., 1996 / Copyright © 1996 American Sociological Association","page":"250-277","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Dynamics and Dilemmas of Collective Action","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2096334","volume":"61"},

Our computation of the PDFs is much less complicated than GFRD and more flexible. The solution of the partial differential equation for the PDF is split into two steps to simplify the calculations. The sampling is without splitting error in two of the coordinate directions for a pair of molecules and a molecule-polymer interaction and is approximate in the third direction. The PDF is obtained either from an analytical solution or a numerical discretization. The errors due to the operator splitting, the partitioning of the system, and the numerical approximations are analyzed. The method is applied to three different systems involving up to four reactions.

  {"id":"hendersonFacilitating2011","abstract":"This article reviews current scholarship about how to promote change in instructional practices used in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses. The review is based on 191 conceptual and empirical journal articles published between 1995 and 2008. Four broad categories of change strategies were developed to capture core differences within this body of literature: disseminating curriculum and pedagogy, developing reflective teachers, enacting policy, and developing shared vision. STEM education researchers largely write about change in terms of disseminating curriculum and pedagogy. Faculty development researchers largely write about change in terms of developing reflective teachers. Higher education researchers largely write about change in terms of enacting policy. New work often does not build on prior empirical or theoretical work. Although most articles claim success of the change strategy studied, evidence presented to support these claims is typically not strong. For example, only 21% of articles that studied implementation of a change strategy were categorized as presenting strong evidence to support claims of success or failure of the strategy. These analyses suggest that the state of change strategies and the study of change strategies are weak, and that research communities that study and enact change are largely isolated from one-another. In spite of the weak state of the literature, some conclusions related to the design of change strategies can be drawn from this review. Two commonly used change strategies are clearly not effective: developing and testing “best practice” curricular materials and then making these materials available to other faculty and “top-down” policy-making meant to influence instructional practices. Effective change strategies: are aligned with or seek to change the beliefs of the individuals involved; involve long-term interventions, lasting at least one semester; require understanding a college or university as a complex system and designing a strategy that is compatible with this system. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

First, detailed spatial simulations are performed using stochastic cellular automata. Then, several analytic approximations are made. First, two versions of mean field theory are presented: the infinite-dispersal mean field approximation, which is a metapopulation-like model, and the local-dispersal mean field approximation, which incorporates the locality of the cellular automaton model but assumes that no spatial correlations develop in the lattice. Next, the local-dispersal mean field theory is generalised into several varieties of local structure theory, in which one assumes that groups of nearby sites in the lattice are correlated, and tracks such correlations under the action of the cellular automaton rule. Assuming such local correlations allows one to predict patch occupancy as well as the degree of clustering in the cellular automaton model much more accurately than mean field theory, especially in parameter regimes where mean field theory does poorly.

  {"id":"holdenHigh2017","abstract":"Consumer demand for plant and animal products threatens many populations with extinction. The anthropogenic Allee effect (AAE) proposes that such extinctions can be caused by prices for wildlife products increasing with species rarity. This price-rarity relationship creates financial incentives to extract the last remaining individuals of a population, despite higher search and harvest costs. The AAE has become a standard approach for conceptualizing the threat of economic markets on endangered species. Despite its potential importance for conservation, AAE theory is based on a simple graphical model with limited analysis of possible population trajectories. By specifying a general class of functions for price-rarity relationships, we provide the first theoretical analysis of AAE models, and show that the classic theory can understate the risk of species extinction. AAE theory proposes that only populations below a critical Allee threshold will go extinct due to increasing price-rarity relationships. Our analysis shows that this threshold can be much higher than the original theory suggests, depending on initial harvest effort. More alarmingly, even species with population sizes above this Allee threshold, for which AAE predicts persistence, can be destined to extinction. Introducing even a minimum price for harvested individuals, close to zero, can cause large populations to cross the classic anthropogenic Allee threshold on a trajectory towards extinction. These results suggest that traditional AAE theory may give a false sense of security when managing large harvested populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Holden","given":"Matthew H."},{"family":"McDonald-Madden","given":"Eve"}],"citation-key":"holdenHigh2017","container-title":"arXiv:1703.06736 [q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,20]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"High prices for rare species can drive large populations extinct: the anthropogenic Allee effect revisited","title-short":"High prices for rare species can drive large populations extinct","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06736"},

  {"id":"huangStochastic2015","abstract":"Frequency dependent selection and demographic fluctuations play important roles in evolutionary and ecological processes. Under frequency dependent selection, the average fitness of the population may increase or decrease based on interactions between individuals within the population. This should be reflected in fluctuations of the population size even in constant environments. Here, we propose a stochastic model, which naturally combines these two evolutionary ingredients by assuming frequency dependent competition between different types in an individual-based model. In contrast to previous game theoretic models, the carrying capacity of the population and thus the population size is determined by pairwise competition of individuals mediated by evolutionary games and demographic stochasticity. In the limit of infinite population size, the averaged stochastic dynamics is captured by the deterministic competitive Lotka-Volterra equations. In small populations, demographic stochasticity may instead lead to the extinction of the entire population. As the population size is driven by the fitness in evolutionary games, a population of cooperators is less prone to go extinct than a population of defectors, whereas in the usual systems of fixed size, the population would thrive regardless of its average payoff.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Weini"},{"family":"Hauert","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Traulsen","given":"Arne"}],"citation-key":"huangStochastic2015","container-title":"arXiv:1506.06572 [q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,22]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Stochastic evolutionary games in dynamic populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06572"},

In some instances, these disparities can be marked enough so as to cast doubt on the implications of cellular automata type simulations for the study of cooperation in social systems.

  {"id":"iftiScaling2003","abstract":"In this thesis we study the behaviour of three- and many-species systems, when the stochastic nature of the interactions within them is taken into consideration. We pay special attention to the appearance of cooperative states in them. We also study a model of development of cooperation, called Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma. We start with the cyclic ABC model (A + B → 2B, B + C → 2C, C + A → 2A), and its counterpart: the three-component neutral drift model (A + B → 2B or 2A, B + C → 2C or 2B, C + A → 2A or 2C). In the former case, the mean-field approximation exhibits cyclic behaviour with an amplitude determined by the initial condition. When stochastic phenomena are taken into account, the amplitude of the oscillations drifts and eventually one and then two of the species go extinct. The second model remains stationary for all initial conditions in the mean-field approximation, and drifts when stochastic phenomena are considered. We analyzed the distribution of first extinction times of both models by simulations of the master equation, and from the point of view of the Fokker-Planck equation. Survival probability vs. time plots suggest an exponential decay. For the neutral model the extinction rate is inversely proportional to the system size, while the cyclic system exhibits anomalous behaviour for small system sizes. In the large system size limit the extinction times for both models will be the same. This result is compatible with the smallest eigenvalue obtained from the numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. We also studied the behaviour of the probability distribution. For evolutionary times, it becomes uniform, which is in agreement with the exponential decay. The exponential behaviour is found to be robust against certain changes, such as the three reactions having different rates. Finally, we study the system with an intermediate selection coefficient, and show that for evolutionary times it behaves like the cyclic (deterministic) and neutral drift models. When mutation or migrations are taken into consideration, there are three distinct regimes in the model, (i) In the \"fixation\" regime, the first extinction time scales with system size N and has exponential distribution with an exponent that depends on the mutation/migration probability µ. (ii) In the \"diversity\" regime, the system accepts the linear noise approximation, and exhibits Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process behaviour. All three species are present in the system at almost all times.' The analytical results are checked against computer simulations of the master equation, (iii) In the critical regime, the first \"extinction time has a power-law distribution with exponent -1. The transition corresponds to a crossover from diffusive behaviour to Gaussian fluctuations around a stable solution. The critical µ is written as µ₀/N and µ₀ is determined from the simulations, as well as numerical solution of a nonlinear- Fokker-Planck equation to be about 0.33. The above-described behaviour is observed for systems with four- or more species, and a possible mechanism for the appearance of symbiotic pairs is discussed. The model is used for emulating a computer network with e-mail viruses. It is observed that clustering is necessary for pandemics to happen. We discuss ' differences between computer users, e-mail, and social network topologies and their role in determining the nature of epidemics. The evolution of cooperation is studied, using the Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma. This is a Prisoner's Dilemma in which the cooperation is not all or nothing, but rather goes through baby steps, from small to bigger degrees of assistance. It has been shown that in the presence of spatial structure the individual's investment reaches substantial levels, and fluctuates around those. We examine the effects of increasing the neighbourhood size, and study the limits at which the mean-field behaviour of pure defection becomes the prevailing one. It is observed that when the neighbourhood sizes for \"playing against\" and \"comparing with\" differ by more than 0.5, the cooperative behaviour is unsustainable. Further, neighbourhood size mutations are introduced, and the parameters are treated as phenotypes. The final state is a cooperative one, and the neighbourhood and dispersal parameters values are observed to converge toward one-another. When placed in a network, it is observed that the average degree of the network for which cooperation is still sustained practically does not depend on network size, and is much larger in the clustered social networks than in the distributed random networks. This further strengthens the argument that clustered spatial structures help the development and maintenance of cooperation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ifti","given":"Margarita"}],"citation-key":"iftiScaling2003","genre":"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",11]]},"title":"Scaling, survival and extinction in many-species systems","type":"webpage","URL":"https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/15937"},

  {"id":"ispolatovWar1996","abstract":"The dynamics of ‘‘vicious,’’ continuously growing civilizations (domains), which engage in ‘‘war’’ whenever two domains meet, is investigated. In the war event, the smaller domain is annihilated, while the larger domain is reduced in size by a fraction ε of the casualties of the loser. Here ε quantifies the fairness of the war, with ε=1 corresponding to a fair war with equal casualties on both sides and ε=0 corresponding to a completely unfair war where the winner suffers no casualties. In the heterogeneous version of the model, evolution begins from a specified initial distribution of domains, while in the homogeneous system, there is a continuous and spatially uniform input of point domains, in addition to the growth and warfare. For the heterogeneous case, the rate equations are derived and solved and comparisons with numerical simulations are made. An exact solution is also derived for the case of equal-size domains in one dimension. The heterogeneous system is found to coarsen, with the typical cluster size growing linearly in time t and the number density of domains decreases as 1/t. For the homogeneous system, two different long-time behaviors arise as a function of ε. When 1/2<ε⩽1 (relatively fair wars), a steady state arises that is characterized by egalitarian competition between domains of comparable size. In the limiting case of ε=1, rate equations that simultaneously account for the distribution of domains and that of the intervening gaps are derived and solved. The steady state is characterized by domains whose age is typically much larger than their size. When 0⩽ε<1/2 (unfair wars), a few ‘‘superpowers’’ ultimately dominate. Simulations indicate that this coarsening process is characterized by power-law temporal behavior, with nonuniversal ε-dependent exponents. Some of these features are captured by a deterministic self-similar model, for which the characteristic exponents can be computed easily.

The network is modeled by a directed weighted graph whose positive and negative links represent `catalytic' and `inhibitory' interactions among the molecular species, and which evolves as the least populated species (typically those that go extinct) are replaced by new ones. A small autocatalytic set (ACS), appearing by chance, provides the seed for the spontaneous growth of connectivity and cooperation in the graph. A highly structured chemical organization arises inevitably as the ACS enlarges and percolates through the network in a short, analytically determined time scale. This self-organization does not require the presence of self-replicating species.

Since the cognitive system includes interconnected and reciprocally influenced neuronal networks, the authors hypothesized that stimulation of lexical–semantic abilities may benefit semantically structured episodic memory. Objective. To investigate the effects of lexical–semantic stimulation (LSS) on verbal communication and episodic memory in early AD. Methods. Forty AD participants were randomized to LSS or unstructured cognitive stimulation (UCS) as control condition. Treatments lasted 3 months, 2 sections a week. The primary outcome measures were the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Verbal Naming Test (VNT), Phonemic and Semantic Fluency, Story Recall, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning (RAVL). Secondary outcome measures were neuropsychological tests assessing cognitive functions not stimulated by the intervention, such as attention, executive functions, and visual–spatial abilities, and the instrumental activities of daily living scale. A 6-month follow-up assessment was administered to the LSS group. Results. LSS treatment yielded significant improvements of the MMSE, BNT, VNT, Brief Story Recall, and RAVL delayed recall mean scores. Among secondary outcome measures, only working memory and the speed of a task assessing executive functions (Stroop test) improved after LSS. Unstructured cognitive stimulation intervention did not improve any cognitive domain. Six months after LSS discontinuation, the MMSE mean score remains significantly higher than the baseline value. Conclusion. LSS treatment may improve episodic memory in AD patients and may be regarded as a clinical option to counteract the cognitive decline typical of the disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Jelcic","given":"Nela"},{"family":"Cagnin","given":"Annachiara"},{"family":"Meneghello","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Turolla","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Ermani","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Dam","given":"Mauro"}],"citation-key":"jelcicEffects2012","container-title":"Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair","container-title-short":"Neurorehabil Neural Repair","DOI":"10.1177/1545968312440146","ISSN":"1545-9683","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"949-956","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Effects of Lexical–Semantic Treatment on Memory in Early Alzheimer Disease: An Observer-Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial","title-short":"Effects of Lexical–Semantic Treatment on Memory in Early Alzheimer Disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1545968312440146","volume":"26"},

For influenza, contenders include temperature, humidity, and vitamin D levels. While such seasonal drivers may be sufficient to explain midwinter peaking it is unclear if other respiratory viruses peaking in spring, summer, or fall have individual environmental drivers. Here we present a dynamic model of interacting diseases, in an effort to explain observed seasonal patterns without requiring multiple seasonal drivers. Our model extends the classical SIRS-model to include multiple diseases that interact via a short-lasting, non-specific immunity component. This temporal protection is triggered by exposure to any epidemic disease and lasts only a couple of weeks. We show that the inhibiting disease-interaction allows recurrent epidemic behaviour without any seasonal driving. In the presence of a single seasonal driver our model parsimoniously predicts epidemic patterns such as sequentially occurring epidemic diseases. We also present a two-disease simulation reproducing multiple features observed in time series of parainfluenza strains PIV-3 and biennial PIV-1 epidemic patterns. Complex epidemic patterns of seasonal diseases may be explained by non-specific innate or cloub cell (T-cell) mediated immune responses that result in interaction between unrelated respiratory epidemic diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Jensen","given":"Gorm Gruner"},{"family":"Uekermann","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Sneppen","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Simonsen","given":"Lone"}],"citation-key":"jensenCould2019","container-title":"arXiv:1908.00925 [nlin, physics:physics, q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,2]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Could short-lasting non-specific immunity explain seasonal spacing of epidemic diseases?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00925"},

These findings suggest that it can give useful insight, to describe the phenomenon of social discrimination in terms of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The investigations so far have, however, only considered binary labels. In this contribution we extend the investigations to models with up to seven different labels. We find the features known from the binary label model remain remarkably robust when the number of labels is increased.

  {"id":"jiangMaterial2016","abstract":"Simulating the physical behaviors of deformable objects and fluids has been an important topic in computer graphics. While the Lagrangian Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used for elasto-plastic solids, it usually requires additional computational components in the case of large deformation, mesh distortion, fracture, self-collision and coupling between materials. Often, special solvers and strategies need to be developed for a particular problem. Recently, the hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method (MPM) was introduced to the graphics community. It uses a continuum description of the governing equations and utilizes user-controllable elasto-plastic constitutive models. The hybrid nature of MPM allows using a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. Like other particle methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), topology change is easy due to the lack of explicit connectivity between Lagrangian particles. Furthermore, MPM allows a grid-based implicit integration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. MPM also provides a unified particle simulation framework similar to Position Based Dynamics (PBD) for easy coupling of different materials. The power of MPM has been demonstrated in a number of recent papers for simulating various materials including elastic objects, snow, lava, sand and viscoelastic fluids. It is also highly integrated into the production framework of Walt Disney Animation Studios and has been used in featured animations including Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Chenfanfu"},{"family":"Schroeder","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Teran","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Stomakhin","given":"Alexey"},{"family":"Selle","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"jiangMaterial2016","collection-title":"SIGGRAPH '16","container-title":"ACM SIGGRAPH 2016 Courses","DOI":"10.1145/2897826.2927348","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4289-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,24]]},"page":"1–52","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"The material point method for simulating continuum materials","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2897826.2927348"},

Furthermore, we show that the largest draw downs of the Nasdaq are outliers with a confidence level better than 99% and that these two speculative bubbles, as well as others, both nicely fit into the quantitative framework proposed by the authors in a series of recent papers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Johansen","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Sornette","given":"Didier"}],"citation-key":"johansenNasdaq2000","container-title":"arXiv:cond-mat/0004263","DOI":"10.1007/s100510070147","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",4,17]]},"note":"European Physical Journal B 17, 319-328 (2000).","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Nasdaq crash of April 2000: Yet another example of log-periodicity in a speculative bubble ending in a crash","title-short":"The Nasdaq crash of April 2000","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0004263"},

  {"id":"johnsonEvolution2011","abstract":"Confidence is an essential ingredient of success in a wide range of domains ranging from job performance and mental health to sports, business and combat. Some authors have suggested that not just confidence but overconfidence—believing you are better than you are in reality—is advantageous because it serves to increase ambition, morale, resolve, persistence or the credibility of bluffing, generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in which exaggerated confidence actually increases the probability of success. However, overconfidence also leads to faulty assessments, unrealistic expectations and hazardous decisions, so it remains a puzzle how such a false belief could evolve or remain stable in a population of competing strategies that include accurate, unbiased beliefs. Here we present an evolutionary model showing that, counterintuitively, overconfidence maximizes individual fitness and populations tend to become overconfident, as long as benefits from contested resources are sufficiently large compared with the cost of competition. In contrast, unbiased strategies are only stable under limited conditions. The fact that overconfident populations are evolutionarily stable in a wide range of environments may help to explain why overconfidence remains prevalent today, even if it contributes to hubris, market bubbles, financial collapses, policy failures, disasters and costly wars.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Dominic D.

It explicitly or implicitly underlies many models of biodiversity of competing species, as well as non-spatial or metapopulation models of persistence of individual species. The model has also been used to study persistence in simple disease models. The stochastic logistic model has direct relevance for questions of limiting similarity in ecological systems. This paper uses a biased random walk heuristic to derive a scaling relationship for the persistence of a population under this model, and discusses its implications for models of biodiversity and persistence.

  {"id":"jonesAge2005","abstract":"Great achievements in knowledge are produced by older innovators today than they were a century ago. Using data on Nobel Prize winners and great inventors, I find that the age at which noted innovations are produced has increased by approximately 6 years over the 20th Century. This trend is consistent with a shift in the life-cycle productivity of great minds. It is also consistent with an aging workforce. The paper employs a semi-parametric maximum likelihood model to (1) test between these competing explanations and (2) locate any specific shifts in life-cycle productivity. The productivity explanation receives considerable support. I find that innovators are much less productive at younger ages, beginning to produce major ideas 8 years later at the end of the 20th Century than they did at the beginning. Furthermore, the later start to the career is not compensated for by increasing productivity beyond early middle age. I show that these distinct shifts for knowledge-based careers are consistent with a knowledge-based theory, where the accumulation of knowledge across generations leads innovators to seek more education over time. More generally, the results show that individual innovators are productive over a narrowing span of their life cycle, a trend that reduces -- other things equal -- the aggregate output of innovators. This drop in productivity is particularly acute if innovators' raw ability is greatest when young.","author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Benjamin F."}],"citation-key":"jonesAge2005","container-title":"National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"source":"National Bureau of Economic Research","title":"Age and Great Invention","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nber.org/papers/w11359","volume":"No. 11359"},

Dominant disadvantages identified were adjustment to teaching style and expectations and confusion and communication issues.

Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Kahneman","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Tversky","given":"Amos"}],"citation-key":"kahnemanProspect1979","container-title":"Econometrica","DOI":"10.2307/1914185","ISSN":"0012-9682","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1979"]]},"page":"263-291","source":"JSTOR","title":"Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk","title-short":"Prospect Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185","volume":"47"},

The experiment was designed to contrast perennially asexual lines with lines that had experienced one or more sexual episodes. All lines were capable of adapting to the novel environment. The sexual lines, however, showed greater adaptation over the course of the experiment, especially in more complex environments. Moreover, the effect of sex on adaptation increased with the number of successive sexual episodes. The time-course of adaptation showed that sex initially caused an increase in the standardized variance of fitness and an initial drop in mean fitness, at least after a second or third sexual episode. These short-term effects were followed by a period of recovery during which the fitness of sexual lines eventually exceeded that of asexual lines. The increase in mean fitness was mirrored by a decrease in the standardized variance of fitness relative to asexuals, suggesting that directional selection used up the variation generated by meiotic recombination and thereby conferred a fitness advantage to the sexual lines. These results support the Weismann-Fisher-Muller hypothesis for the maintenance of sex in natural populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kaltz","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Bell","given":"Graham"}],"citation-key":"kaltzEcology2002","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00188.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1743-1753","source":"onlinelibrary.wiley.com","title":"The Ecology and Genetics of Fitness in Chlamydomonas.

One of the species $Y$ is assumed to have a slower synthesis speed. Through divisions of the protocells, the system reaches and remains in a state in which there are only a few active $Y$ and almost no inactive $Y$ molecules in most protocells, through selection of very rare fluctuations. In this state, the active $Y$ molecules are shown to control the behavior of the protocell. The minority molecule species act as the information carrier, due to the relatively discrete nature of its population, in comparison with the majority species which behaves statistically in accordance with the law of large numbers.

  {"id":"kauffmanHome1995","abstract":"A major scientific revolution has begun, a new paradigm that rivals Darwin's theory in importance. At its heart is the discovery of the order that lies deep within the most complex of systems, from the origin of life, to the workings of giant corporations, to the rise and fall of great civilizations. And more than anyone else, this revolution is the work of one man, Stuart Kauffman, a MacArthur Fellow and visionary pioneer of the new science of complexity. Now, in At Home in the Universe, Kauffman brilliantly weaves together the excitement of intellectual discovery and a fertile mix of insights to give the general reader a fascinating look at this new science--and at the forces for order that lie at the edge of chaos. We all know of instances of spontaneous order in nature--an oil droplet in water forms a sphere, snowflakes have a six-fold symmetry. What we are only now discovering, Kauffman says, is that the range of spontaneous order is enormously greater than we had supposed. Indeed, self-organization is a great undiscovered principle of nature. But how does this spontaneous order arise? Kauffman contends that complexity itself triggers self-organization, or what he calls \"order for free,\" that if enough different molecules pass a certain threshold of complexity, they begin to self-organize into a new entity--a living cell. Kauffman uses the analogy of a thousand buttons on a rug--join two buttons randomly with thread, then another two, and so on. At first, you have isolated pairs; later, small clusters; but suddenly at around the 500th repetition, a remarkable transformation occurs--much like the phase transition when water abruptly turns to ice--and the buttons link up in one giant network. Likewise, life may have originated when the mix of different molecules in the primordial soup passed a certain level of complexity and self-organized into living entities (if so, then life is not a highly improbable chance event, but almost inevitable). Kauffman uses the basic insight of \"order for free\" to illuminate a staggering range of phenomena. We see how a single-celled embryo can grow to a highly complex organism with over two hundred different cell types. We learn how the science of complexity extends Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection: that self-organization, selection, and chance are the engines of the biosphere. And we gain insights into biotechnology, the stunning magic of the new frontier of genetic engineering--generating trillions of novel molecules to find new drugs, vaccines, enzymes, biosensors, and more. Indeed, Kauffman shows that ecosystems, economic systems, and even cultural systems may all evolve according to similar general laws, that tissues and terra cotta evolve in similar ways. And finally, there is a profoundly spiritual element to Kauffman's thought. If, as he argues, life were bound to arise, not as an incalculably improbable accident, but as an expected fulfillment of the natural order, then we truly are at home in the universe. Kauffman's earlier volume, The Origins of Order, written for specialists, received lavish praise. Stephen Jay Gould called it \"a landmark and a classic.\" And Nobel Laureate Philip Anderson wrote that \"there are few people in this world who ever ask the right questions of science, and they are the ones who affect its future most profoundly. Stuart Kauffman is one of these.\" In At Home in the Universe, this visionary thinker takes you along as he explores new insights into the nature of life.","author":[{"family":"Kauffman","given":"Stuart A."}],"citation-key":"kauffmanHome1995","ISBN":"978-0-19-509599-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"348","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"At home in the universe: the search for laws of self-organization and complexity","title-short":"At home in the universe","type":"book"},

Extinction, however, can also be driven by endogenous factors, such as the ecological interactions between species in an ecosystem. Here we show that endogenously driven extinction events can have a scale-free distribution in simple spatially structured host–parasitoid systems. Due to the properties of this distribution there may be many such simple ecosystems that, although not strictly permanent, persist for arbitrarily long periods of time. We identify a critical phase transition in the parameter space of the host–parasitoid systems, and explain how this is related to the scale-free nature of the extinction process. Based on these results, we conjecture that scale-free extinction processes and critical phase transitions of the type we have found may be a characteristic feature of many spatially structured, multi-species ecosystems in nature. The necessary ingredient appears to be competition between species where the locally inferior type disperses faster in space. If this condition is satisfied then the eventual outcome depends subtly on the strength of local superiority of one species versus the dispersal rate of the other.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Killingback","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Blok","given":"Hendrik J.

  {"id":"killingbackVariable1999","abstract":"Cooperation is fundamental to many biological systems. A common metaphor for studying the evolution of cooperation is the Prisoner's Dilemma, a game with two strategies: cooperate or defect. However, cooperation is rare all or nothing, and its evolution probably involves the gradual extension of initially modest degrees of assistance. The inability of the Prisoner's Dilemma to capture this basic aspect limits its use for understanding the evolutionary origins of cooperation. Here we consider a framework for cooperation based on the concept of investment: an act which is costly, but which benefits other individuals, where the cost and benefit depend on the level of investment made. In the resulting Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma the essential problem of cooperation remains: in the absence of any additional structure non-zero levels of investment cannot evolve. However, if investments are considered in a spatially structured context, selfish individuals who make arbitrarily low investments can be invaded by higher-investing mutants. This results in the mean level of investment evolving to significant levels, where it is maintained indefinitely. This approach provides a natural solution to the fundamental problem of how cooperation gradually increases from a non-cooperative state.","author":[{"family":"Killingback","given":"T"},{"family":"Doebeli","given":"M"},{"family":"Knowlton","given":"N"}],"citation-key":"killingbackVariable1999","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Biol Sci","ISSN":"0962-8452","issue":"1430","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",9,7]]},"page":"1723-1728","PMCID":"1690197","PMID":"10518320","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Variable investment, the Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma, and the origin of cooperation.","type":"article-journal","volume":"266"},

Using these e-portfolios, I then present a completely new approach to assessment developed in association with the former head of research at the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate. The approach was (on the face of it) simple, using a web-based interface. But the outcome was astonishing – producing reliability statistics of 0.93: far higher than can be achieved in normal coursework assessment. The issues that this approach raises are many and profound, not the least of which is the possibility of a new, trustworthy, conceptualisation of what coursework assessment might become.

  {"id":"kimValidity2014","abstract":"In biochemical networks, reactions often occur on disparate timescales and can be characterized as either \"fast\" or \"slow.\" The quasi-steady state approximation (QSSA) utilizes timescale separation to project models of biochemical networks onto lower-dimensional slow manifolds. As a result, fast elementary reactions are not modeled explicitly, and their effect is captured by non-elementary reaction rate functions (e.g. Hill functions). The accuracy of the QSSA applied to deterministic systems depends on how well timescales are separated. Recently, it has been proposed to use the non-elementary rate functions obtained via the deterministic QSSA to define propensity functions in stochastic simulations of biochemical networks. In this approach, termed the stochastic QSSA, fast reactions that are part of non-elementary reactions are not simulated, greatly reducing computation time. However, it is unclear when the stochastic QSSA provides an accurate approximation of the original stochastic simulation. We show that, unlike the deterministic QSSA, the validity of the stochastic QSSA does not follow from timescale separation alone, but also depends on the sensitivity of the non-elementary reaction rate functions to changes in the slow species. The stochastic QSSA becomes more accurate when this sensitivity is small. Different types of QSSAs result in non-elementary functions with different sensitivities, and the total QSSA results in less sensitive functions than the standard or the pre-factor QSSA. We prove that, as a result, the stochastic QSSA becomes more accurate when non-elementary reaction functions are obtained using the total QSSA. Our work provides a novel condition for the validity of the QSSA in stochastic simulations of biochemical reaction networks with disparate timescales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Jae Kyoung"},{"family":"Josić","given":"Krešimir"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Matthew R."}],"citation-key":"kimValidity2014","container-title":"arXiv:1406.2244 [q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,9]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"The validity of quasi steady-state approximations in discrete stochastic simulations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2244"},
  {"id":"kingAvoidable2014","abstract":"As an emergent infectious disease outbreak unfolds, public health response is reliant on information on key epidemiological quantities, such as transmission potential and serial interval. Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely-used modeling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in many such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts is itself far over-estimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and computationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the standard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Second, we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from the 2014 West African Ebola virus disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in estimates and forecasts is better quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"King","given":"Aaron A."},{"family":"Cellès","given":"Matthieu Domenech","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Magpantay","given":"Felicia M.

Nevertheless, it emerged in the mid-1930's as a central model of experimental population biology, and in its various modifications has remained an important part of modern population ecology. The history of the logistic curve reveals that its acceptance was by no means straightforward: repeated promotion of the curve by Pearl and his connections to other scientists were both important in the establishment of its place as a tool of research. The people responsible for legitimizing the logistic curve - A. J. Lotka, G. F. Gause, G. Udny Yule, and Thomas Park - all had different degrees of direct contact with Pearl in the early years of its use, and these personal contacts facilitated the acceptance of the logistic curve despite the heawy criticisms.

Here we make a linear stability analysis of the mean field fixed points of three adaptive SOC systems. We find that the fixed points correspond to barely stable spirals that turn out indifferent at criticality where a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation occurs. This near indifference means that, in real systems, finite-size fluctuations (as well as external noise) can excite both stochastic oscillations and avalanches.

However, extra features of the disease dynamics or of the network lead to an increase in system size and analytical tractability becomes problematic. Various `closures' can be used to keep the system tractable. Focusing on SIR epidemics on regular but clustered networks, we show that even for the most complex closure we can determine the epidemic threshold as an asymptotic expansion in terms of the clustering coefficient.We do this by exploiting the presence of a system of fast variables, specified by the correlation structure of the epidemic, whose steady state determines the epidemic threshold. While we do not find the steady state analytically, we create an elegant asymptotic expansion of it. We validate this new threshold by comparing it to the numerical solution of the full system and find excellent agreement over a wide range of values of the clustering coefficient, transmission rate and average degree of the network. The technique carries over to pairwise models with other closures [1] and we note that the epidemic threshold will be model dependent.

  {"id":"kornellBest2016","abstract":"We review recent studies that asked: do college students learn relatively more from teachers whom they rate highly on student evaluation forms? Recent studies measured learning at two-time points. When learning was measured with a test at the end of the course, the teachers who got the highest ratings were the ones who contributed the most to learning. But when learning was measured as performance in subsequent related courses, the teachers who had received relatively low ratings appeared to have been most effective. We speculate about why these effects occurred: making a course difficult in productive ways may decrease ratings but enhance learning. Despite their limitations, we do not suggest abandoning student ratings, but do recommend that student evaluation scores should not be the sole basis for evaluating college teaching and they should be recognized for what they are.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kornell","given":"Nate"},{"family":"Hausman","given":"Hannah"}],"citation-key":"kornellBest2016","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00570","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,25]]},"PMCID":"PMC4842911","PMID":"27199807","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Do the Best Teachers Get the Best Ratings?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842911/","volume":"7"},

For lattice systems with short-range interactions, the progress of the conservative PDES scheme is governed by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation from the theory of non-equilibrium surface growth. Although the simulated (virtual) times of the PEs progress at a nonzero rate, their standard deviation (spread) diverges with the number of PEs, hindering efficient data collection. We show that weak random interactions among the PEs can make this spread nondivergent. The PEs then progress at a nonzero, near-uniform rate without requiring global synchronizations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Korniss","given":"G."},{"family":"Novotny","given":"M.

  {"id":"kramerAllee2008","abstract":"Understanding the dynamics of populations at low density and the role of Allee effects is a priority due to concern about the decline of rare species and interest in colonization/invasion dynamics. Despite well-developed theory and observational support, experimental examinations of the Allee effect in natural systems are rare, partly because of logistical difficulties associated with experiments at low population density. We took advantage of fish introduction and removal in alpine lakes to experimentally test for the Allee effect at the whole-ecosystem scale. The large copepod Hesperodiaptomus shoshone is often extirpated from the water column by fish and sometimes fails to recover following fish disappearance, despite the presence of a long-lived egg bank. Population growth rate of this dioecious species may be limited by mate encounter rate, such that below some critical density a colonizing population will fail to establish. We conducted a multi-lake experiment in which H. shoshone was stocked at densities that bracketed our hypothesized critical density of 0.5-5 copoepods/m3. Successful recovery by the copepod was observed only in the lake with the highest initial density (3 copepods/m3). Copepods stocked into small cages at 3000 copepods/m3 survived and reproduced at rates comparable to natural populations, confirming that the lakes were suitable habitat for this species. In support of mate limitation as the mechanism underlying recovery failure, we found a significant positive relationship between mating success and density across experimental and natural H. shoshone populations. Furthermore, a mesocosm experiment provided evidence of increased per capita population growth rate with increasing population density in another diaptomid species, Skistodiaptomus pallidus. Together, these lines of evidence support the importance of the Allee effect to population recovery of H. shoshone in the Sierra Nevada, and to diaptomid copepods in general.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kramer","given":"Andrew M"},{"family":"Sarnelle","given":"Orlando"},{"family":"Knapp","given":"Roland A"}],"citation-key":"kramerAllee2008","container-title":"Ecology","container-title-short":"Ecology","ISSN":"0012-9658","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",10]]},"page":"2760-2769","PMID":"18959313","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Allee effect limits colonization success of sexually reproducing zooplankton","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18959313","volume":"89"},
  {"id":"krapivskyOrganization2001","abstract":"The organizational development of growing random networks is investigated. These growing networks are built by adding nodes successively, and linking each to an earlier node of degree k with an attachment probability Ak. When Ak grows more slowly than linearly with k, the number of nodes with k links, Nk(t), decays faster than a power law in k, while for Ak growing faster than linearly in k, a single node emerges which connects to nearly all other nodes. When Ak is asymptotically linear, Nk(t)∼tk-ν, with ν dependent on details of the attachment probability, but in the range 2<ν<∞. The combined age and degree distribution of nodes shows that old nodes typically have a large degree. There is also a significant correlation in the degrees of neighboring nodes, so that nodes of similar degree are more likely to be connected. The size distributions of the in and out components of the network with respect to a given node—namely, its “descendants” and “ancestors”—are also determined. The in component exhibits a robust s-2 power-law tail, where s is the component size. The out component has a typical size of order lnt, and it provides basic insights into the genealogy of the network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Krapivsky","given":"P.

  {"id":"lanteriHow2020","abstract":"Macroscopic growth laws, solutions of mean field equations, describe in an effective way an underlying complex dynamics. They are applied to study the spreading of infections, as in the case of CoviD-19, where the counting of the cumulated number $N(t)$ of detected infected individuals is a generally accepted, coarse-grain, variable to understand the epidemic phase. However $N(t)$ does not take into account the unknown number of asymptomatic, not detected, cases $A(t)$. Therefore, the question arises if the observed time series of data of $N(t)$ is a reliable tool for monitoring the evolution of the infectious disease. We study a system of coupled differential equations which includes the dynamics of the spreading among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and the strong containment effects due to the social isolation. The solution is therefore compared with a macroscopic law for the population $N(t)$ coming from a single, non-linear, differential equation with no explicit reference to $A(t)$, showing the equivalence of the two methods. Indeed, $N(t)$ takes into account a more complex and detailed population dynamics which permits the evaluation of the number of asymptomatic individuals also. The model is then applied to Covid-19 spreading in Italy where a transition from an exponential behavior to a Gompertz growth for $N(t)$ has been observed in more recent data. Then the information contained in the data analysis of $N(t)$ is reliable to understand the epidemic phase, although it does not describe the total infected population. The asymptomatic population is larger than the symptomatic one in the fast growth phase of the spreading.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Lanteri","given":"D."},{"family":"Carco'","given":"D."},{"family":"Castorina","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"lanteriHow2020","container-title":"arXiv:2003.12457 [physics, q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,27]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"How macroscopic laws describe complex dynamics: asymptomatic population and CoviD-19 spreading","title-short":"How macroscopic laws describe complex dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12457"},

  {"id":"levineImpact2012","abstract":"We study the combined impact of a colored environmental noise and demographic noise on the extinction risk of a long-lived and well-mixed isolated stochastic population which exhibits the Allee effect. The environmental noise modulates the population birth and death rates. Assuming that the Allee effect is strong, and the environmental noise is positively correlated and Gaussian, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the joint probability distribution of the population sizes and environmental fluctuations. In WKB approximation this equation reduces to an effective two-dimensional Hamiltonian mechanics, where the most likely path to extinction and the most likely environmental fluctuation are encoded in an instanton-like trajectory in the phase space. The mean time to extinction (MTE) is related to the mechanical action along this trajectory. We obtain new analytic results for short-correlated, long-correlated and relatively weak environmental noise. The population-size dependence of the MTE changes from exponential for weak environmental noise to no dependence for strong noise, implying a greatly increased extinction risk. The theory is readily extendable to population switches between different metastable states, and to stochastic population explosion, due to a combined action of demographic and environmental noise.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Levine","given":"Eitan Y."},{"family":"Meerson","given":"Baruch"}],"citation-key":"levineImpact2012","container-title":"arXiv:1210.6436","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",10,24]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Impact of Colored Environmental Noise on the Extinction of a Long-Lived Stochastic Population: the Role of Allee Effect","title-short":"Impact of Colored Environmental Noise on the Extinction of a Long-Lived Stochastic Population","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6436"},

Here we generalize population structure by arranging individuals on a graph. Each vertex represents an individual. The weighted edges denote reproductive rates which govern how often individuals place offspring into adjacent vertices. The homogeneous population, described by the Moran process3, is the special case of a fully connected graph with evenly weighted edges. Spatial structures are described by graphs where vertices are connected with their nearest neighbours. We also explore evolution on random and scale-free networks5, 6, 7. We determine the fixation probability of mutants, and characterize those graphs for which fixation behaviour is identical to that of a homogeneous population7. Furthermore, some graphs act as suppressors and others as amplifiers of selection. It is even possible to find graphs that guarantee the fixation of any advantageous mutant. We also study frequency-dependent selection and show that the outcome of evolutionary games can depend entirely on the structure of the underlying graph. Evolutionary graph theory has many fascinating applications ranging from ecology to multi-cellular organization and economics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Lieberman","given":"Erez"},{"family":"Hauert","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Martin A."}],"citation-key":"liebermanEvolutionary2005","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature03204","ISSN":"0028-0836","issue":"7023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",1,20]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2005 Nature Publishing Group","page":"312-316","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Evolutionary dynamics on graphs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7023/abs/nature03204.html","volume":"433"},

We find that persistent correlations for brief time intervals can arise by inertial movement, while for the long time intervals antipersistent correlations can arise from the fact that the natural system is bounded.

Coupled patch models, based on a within-patch Ronsenzweig–MacArthur Model, are adopted to investigate the impact of predator pursuit (PP) and prey evasion (PE) on the spatial synchrony and pattern formation in metapopulation framework. PP indicates that predators migrate not only from patches of higher predator density to those of lower predator density but also from patches of lower prey density to those of higher prey density; while, PE describes that prey migrate not only from patches of higher prey density to those of lower prey density but also from patches of higher predator density to those of lower predator density. Results show that either PP or PE can reduce spatial synchrony and result in the improvement of metapopulation persistence. Spatially explicit predator–prey system with local migration but without PP and PE can produce self-organized spatial patterns such as circular waves. The effect of PP and PE on spatial predator–prey system can decrease the spatial synchrony and change the circular waves to spatial chaos; therefore, these factors increase the spatial complexity and improve the metapopulation persistence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Zi-zhen"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Hui","given":"Cang"},{"family":"Han","given":"Xiao-zhuo"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Honghua"}],"citation-key":"liImpact2005","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2004.12.008","ISSN":"0304-3800","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",7,10]]},"page":"245-254","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Impact of predator pursuit and prey evasion on synchrony and spatial patterns in metapopulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380004006192","volume":"185"},

The exceptional simplicity of physics-based functions hinges on properties such as symmetry, locality, compositionality and polynomial log-probability, and we explore how these properties translate into exceptionally simple neural networks approximating both natural phenomena such as images and abstract representations thereof such as drawings. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to renormalization group procedures.

Although the simultaneous measurement of all internal variables, like all metabolite concentrations in a cell, offers a complete description of a system’s state, in practice experimental access is limited to only a subset of variables, or sensors. A system is called observable if we can reconstruct the system’s complete internal state from its outputs. Here, we adopt a graphical approach derived from the dynamical laws that govern a system to determine the sensors that are necessary to reconstruct the full internal state of a complex system. We apply this approach to biochemical reaction systems, finding that the identified sensors are not only necessary but also sufficient for observability. The developed approach can also identify the optimal sensors for target or partial observability, helping us reconstruct selected state variables from appropriately chosen outputs, a prerequisite for optimal biomarker design.

For such models, it is important to determine to what extent the specific procedure which is used to update local states affects the overall regimes, as the latter might turn out to be artifacts due to an unrealistic digitalization of the world. The chances of generating spatiotemporal patterns with no counterparts in the physical world are particularly high with granular space-time models that rely on a synchronous evolution of distributed states, as such synchronous evolution is found in nature most typically in systems governed by evolution laws in the form of partial differential equations. We show this possibility to be the case for the regimes produced in coupled map lattices, as markedly different dynamics arise when the standard synchronous model is made asynchronous. By quantifying the degree of mutual asynchrony in the system, signatures of asynchronous spatiotemporal dynamics are unraveled and further characterized in terms of simple stability measures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Lumer","given":"Erik D."},{"family":"Nicolis","given":"Grégoire"}],"citation-key":"lumerSynchronous1994","container-title":"Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena","DOI":"10.1016/0167-2789(94)90010-8","ISSN":"0167-2789","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",3,15]]},"page":"440-452","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Synchronous versus asynchronous dynamics in spatially distributed systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167278994900108","volume":"71"},

  {"id":"machtaParameter2013","abstract":"The microscopically complicated real world exhibits behavior that often yields to simple yet quantitatively accurate descriptions. Predictions are possible despite large uncertainties in microscopic parameters, both in physics and in multiparameter models in other areas of science. We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion) and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.\nInformation Physics\nMultiparameter models, which can emerge in biology and other disciplines, are often sensitive to only a small number of parameters and robust to changes in the rest; approaches from information theory can be used to distinguish between the two parameter groups. In physics, on the other hand, one does not need to know the details at smaller length and time scales in order to understand the behavior on large scales. This hierarchy has been recognized for a long time and formalized within the renormalization group (RG) approach. Machta et al. (p. 604) explored the connection between two scales by using an information-theoretical approach based on the Fisher Information Matrix to analyze two commonly used physics models—diffusion in one dimension and the Ising model of magnetism—as the time and length scales, respectively, were progressively coarsened. The expected “stiff” parameters emerged, in agreement with RG intuition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Machta","given":"Benjamin B."},{"family":"Chachra","given":"Ricky"},{"family":"Transtrum","given":"Mark K."},{"family":"Sethna","given":"James P."}],"citation-key":"machtaParameter2013","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1238723","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6158","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,11]]},"language":"en","page":"604-607","PMID":"24179222","source":"www.sciencemag.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca","title":"Parameter Space Compression Underlies Emergent Theories and Predictive Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6158/604","volume":"342"},

The Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is a disruptive technology in transportation and its impact could resonate through all levels of society and government. The impact on infrastructure spending and decisions is one of the greatest reasons for understanding the potential outcomes of the technology but, in addition, the potential of the technology to play a positive role for the less advantaged members of society is large if there is proper direction of the technology as it is implemented. Auto makers view the technology as something which offers their customers a higher level of convenience and safety and, as such, they are in heated competition to develop this technology. In order to understand and speculate on the systemic urban impact of this nascent transportation technology, a comprehensive methodology is required. This paper will present, substantiate and describe such methodology. We base our proposal on existing future envisioning techniques for business decision making, precedent discussions on the impact of AVs, and on visionary traditions of architectural and urban design. We do not intend a precise method for future prediction, but rather a useful and robust tool that can be used by decision makers to take better informed decision on maximizing benefits and mitigating problems of new transportation technologies with regard to the quality of urban environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Maia","given":"Sara Costa"},{"family":"Meyboom","given":"Annalisa"}],"citation-key":"maiaUnderstanding2018","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Mobility","container-title":"Road Vehicle Automation 4","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-60934-8_17","ISBN":"978-3-319-60933-1 978-3-319-60934-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"201-221","publisher":"Springer, Cham","source":"link-springer-com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca","title":"Understanding the Effects of Autonomous Vehicles on Urban Form","type":"chapter","URL":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-60934-8_17"},

A wide range of models is already available for this type of analysis, and the field is still under active development. One of the most needed developments concerns models that better account for the effect of within- and between-clade interspecific interactions on trait evolution, that can result from processes as diverse as competition, predation, parasitism, or mutualism. Here, we begin by developing a very general comparative phylogenetic framework for (multi)-trait evolution that can be applied to both ultrametric and non-ultrametric trees. This framework not only encapsulates all previous classical models of univariate and multivariate phenotypic evolution, but also paves the way for the consideration of a much broader series of models in which lineages co-evolve, meaning that trait changes in one lineage are influenced by the value of traits in other, interacting lineages. Next, we provide a standard way for deriving the probabilistic distribution of traits at tip branches under our framework. We show that a multivariate normal distribution remains the expected distribution for a broad class of models accounting for interspecific interactions. Our derivations allow us to fit various models efficiently, and in particular greatly reduce the computation time needed to fit the recently proposed phenotype matching model. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our framework by developing a toy model for mutualistic coevolution. Our framework should foster a new era in the study of coevolution from comparative data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Manceau","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Lambert","given":"Amaury"},{"family":"Morlon","given":"Helene"}],"citation-key":"manceauUnifying2016","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/069518","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,14]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2016, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

First, the MMAR contains long-tails, as in Mandelbrot\n(1963), which focused on Lévy-stable distributions. In contrast to Mandelbrot (1963),\nthis model does not necessarily imply infinite variance. Second, the model contains\nlong-dependence, the characteristic feature of fractional Brownian Motion (FBM), in-\ntroduced by Mandelbrot and van Ness (1968). In contrast to FBM, the multifractal\nmodel displays long dependence in the absolute value of price increments, while price\nincrements themselves can be uncorrelated. As such, the MMAR is an alternative to\nARCH-type representations that have been the focus of empirical research on the distri-\nbution of prices for the past fifteen years. The distinguishing feature of the multifractal\nmodel is multiscaling of the return distribution’s moments under time-rescalings.

We consider a hypothetical situation of a portfolio composed of N uncorrelated stocks. Each stock price follows a multiplicative random walk with identical drift and dispersion. The rules of our model naturally give rise to power law tails in the distribution of capital fractions invested in different stocks. The exponent of this scale free distribution is calculated in both discrete and continuous time formalism. It is demonstrated that the dynamical redistribution strategy results in a larger typical growth rate of the capital than a static ``buy-and-hold'' strategy. In the large N limit the typical growth rate is shown to asymptotically approach that of the expectation value of the stock price. The finite dimensional variant of the model is shown to describe the partition function of directed polymers in random media.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Marsili","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Maslov","given":"Sergei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yi-Cheng"}],"citation-key":"marsiliDynamical1998","container-title":"arXiv:cond-mat/9801239","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",1,22]]},"note":"Physica A 253, 403-418 (1998).","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Dynamical Optimization Theory of a Diversified Portfolio","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9801239"},

It assumes ``local'' rationality in the sense that any player climbs the gradient of his utility function in the presence of a stochastic force which represents deviation from rationality in the form of a ``heat bath''. We focus on particular games of a large number of players with a global interaction which is typical of economic systems. The stable states of this dynamics coincide with the Nash equilibria of game theory. We study the gaussian fluctuations around these equilibria and establish that fluctuations around competitive equilibria increase with the number of players. In other words, competitive equilibria are characterized by very broad and uneven distributions among players.

When there do exist rate constants that give rise to multiple steady states, such rate constants can in fact be exhibited. If multiple steady states are observed in a laboratory reactor with poorly understood chemistry, the theory provides sensitive means to screen candidates for the operative chemical mechanism.

  {"id":"maselMultidimensional2014","abstract":"Standard population genetics models assign relative fitness values to genotypes. Normalization ensures that the absolute population mean fitness stays equal to one, keeping the population size constant. These models fail to describe extinction and evolutionary rescue; this requires a model of absolute fitness in the presence of density-dependence. Meantime, ecological models describe absolute fitness traits such as resource uptake speed and resource use efficiency, while neglecting intrinsically relative fitness competitions such as territorial contests and mate choice. Here I present a model that unifies population genetic and ecological notions of relative and absolute fitness. I begin by correcting a subscript flaw in MacArthur's r/K selection theory, and then introduce a third dimension c to capture relative competitiveness. In this model, r gives reproductive speed at low density and has time units, K' gives the parsimoniousness of resource use and has units of population density, and c gives competitive dominance at high density, and is, like population genetic fitness w, always normalized and hence intrinsically unitless. MacArthur's original r/K selection theory is shown to confound c and K'. Applications to experimental evolution and other data are outlined, including a connection to Grime's triangle of reproductive strategies and Nicholson's contest vs. scramble distinction. Extensions to larger numbers of dimensions, including the explicit tracking of consumable resources, are described.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Masel","given":"Joanna"}],"citation-key":"maselMultidimensional2014","container-title":"arXiv:1407.1024 [q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7,3]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"The multidimensional eco-evolutionary \"fitness\" of a genotype, describing absolute growth, absolute efficiency, and relative competitiveness","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1024"},

We suggest that chain-like or cyclic invasions involving three or more species open for creation of spatially separated sub-populations that subsequently can lead to increased diversity. In contrast to its non-spatial counterpart, our model predicts robust co-existence of a large number of species, in accordance with observations on lichen growth.

However, these few driver alterations reside in a cancer genome alongside tens of thousands of additional mutations termed passengers. Passengers are widely believed to have no role in cancer, yet many passengers fall within protein-coding genes and other functional elements that can have potentially deleterious effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate the potential of moderately deleterious passengers to accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic progression. Our approach combines evolutionary simulations of cancer progression with an analysis of cancer sequencing data. From simulations, we find that passengers accumulate and largely evade natural selection during progression. Although individually weak, the collective burden of passengers alters the course of progression, leading to several oncological phenomena that are hard to explain with a traditional driver-centric view. We then tested the predictions of our model using cancer genomics data and confirmed that many passengers are likely damaging and have largely evaded negative selection. Finally, we use our model to explore cancer treatments that exploit the load of passengers by either (i) increasing the mutation rate or (ii) exacerbating their deleterious effects. Though both approaches lead to cancer regression, the latter is a more effective therapy. Our results suggest a unique framework for understanding cancer progression as a balance of driver and passenger mutations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"McFarland","given":"Christopher D."},{"family":"Korolev","given":"Kirill S."},{"family":"Kryukov","given":"Gregory V."},{"family":"Sunyaev","given":"Shamil R."},{"family":"Mirny","given":"Leonid A."}],"citation-key":"mcfarlandImpact2013","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1213968110","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2,6]]},"language":"en","PMID":"23388632","source":"www.pnas.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca","title":"Impact of deleterious passenger mutations on cancer progression","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/content/early/2013/02/05/1213968110"},

Whereas a wide range of proposed solutions attempt to address apparent deficiencies in current educational models, a growing body of literature consistently points to the need to rethink the traditional in-class, lecture-based course model. One such proposal is the flipped classroom, in which content is offloaded for students to learn on their own, and class time is dedicated to engaging students in student-centered learning activities, like problem-based learning and inquiry-oriented strategies.\n        In 2012, the authors flipped a required first-year pharmaceutics course at the University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy. They offloaded all lectures to self-paced online videos and used class time to engage students in active learning exercises. In this article, the authors describe the philosophy and methodology used to redesign the Basic Pharmaceutics II course and outline the research they conducted to investigate the resulting outcomes. This article is intended to serve as a guide to instructors and educational programs seeking to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative and practical strategies to transform students’ learning experience.\n        As class attendance, students’ learning, and the perceived value of this model all increased following participation in the flipped classroom, the authors conclude that this approach warrants careful consideration as educators aim to enhance learning, improve outcomes, and fully equip students to address 21st-century health care needs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"McLaughlin","given":"Jacqueline E."},{"family":"Roth","given":"Mary T."},{"family":"Glatt","given":"Dylan M."},{"family":"Gharkholonarehe","given":"Nastaran"},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Griffin","given":"LaToya M."},{"family":"Esserman","given":"Denise A."},{"family":"Mumper","given":"Russell J."}],"citation-key":"mclaughlinFlipped2014","container-title":"Academic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/ACM.0000000000000086","ISSN":"1040-2446","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2]]},"language":"en-US","page":"236","source":"journals.lww.com","title":"The Flipped Classroom: A Course Redesign to Foster Learning and Engagement in a Health Professions School","title-short":"The Flipped Classroom","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/Fulltext/2014/02000/The_Flipped_Classroom___A_Course_Redesign_to.17.aspx","volume":"89"},
  {"id":"mcsheaComplexity2013","abstract":"The eye and brain: standard thinking is that these devices are both complex and functional. They are complex in the sense of having many different types of parts, and functional in the sense of having capacities that promote survival and reproduction. Standard thinking says that the evolution of complex functionality proceeds by the addition of new parts, and that this build-up of complexity is driven by selection, by the functional advantages of complex design. The standard thinking could be right, even in general. But alternatives have not been much discussed or investigated, and the possibility remains open that other routes may not only exist but may be the norm. Our purpose here is to introduce a new route to functional complexity, a route in which complexity starts high, rising perhaps on account of the spontaneous tendency for parts to differentiate. Then, driven by selection for effective and efficient function, complexity decreases over time. Eventually, the result is a system that is highly functional and retains considerable residual complexity, enough to impress us.

This essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble and to continue to learn. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.

  {"id":"mesaHurst1993","abstract":"After more than 40 years the so-called Hurst effect remains an open problem in stochastic hydrology. Historically, its existence has been explained either by preasymptotic behavior of the rescaled adjusted range R n * , certain classes of nonstationarity in time series, infinite memory, or erroneous estimation of the Hurst exponent. Various statistical tests to determine whether an observed time series exhibits the Hurst effect are presented. The tests are based on the fact that for the family of processes in the Brownian domain of attraction, R n * / ( ( θ n ) ) 1 / 2 converges in distribution to a nondegenerate random variable with known distribution (functional central limit theorem). The scale of fluctuation θ, defined as the sum of the correlation function, plays a key role. Application of the tests to several geophysical time series seems to indicate that they do not exhibit the Hurst effect, although those series have been used as examples of its existence, and furthermore the traditional pox diagram method to estimate the Hurst exponent gives values larger than 0.5. It turned out that the coefficient in the relation of R n * versus n, which is directly proportional to the scale of fluctuation, was more important than the exponent. The Hurst effect motivated the popularization of 1/f noises and related ideas of fractals and scaling. This work illustrates how delicate the procedures to deal with infinity must be.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Mesa","given":"Oscar J."},{"family":"Poveda","given":"German"}],"citation-key":"mesaHurst1993","container-title":"Water Resources Research","container-title-short":"Water Resour.

The prevalence of colorectal cancer increases significantly with age, with 40% of patients in Europe being >75 years of age at the time of initial diagnosis. Furthermore, the number of elderly patients with colorectal cancer is expected to increase significantly over the next two decades. Treatment of advanced colorectal cancer has evolved dramatically over the last decade. Advances in surgery and chemotherapy are effective in prolonging time to disease progression and survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. For >40 years, fluorouracil has been the mainstay of chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer. Recently, however, newer cytotoxic chemotherapies and biological agents effective against colorectal cancer have been shown to improve overall survival in metastatic disease. Thus, a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer today has an expected median survival of 20 months compared with 10 months only a few years ago. There is evidence that elderly individuals derive as much survival benefit from standard chemotherapy approaches in metastatic colorectal cancer as younger patients. Unfortunately, most older patients who might benefit from chemotherapy are not offered this treatment, and the fraction who are not offered it increases with increasing age. Treatment decisions should not be made on the basis of age. Rather, they should be based on functional status, the presence of co-morbidities, and consideration of drug-specific toxicities that can be aggravated in older individuals because of decreased functional reserve. Although the elderly have been under-represented in clinical trials, studies also support the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in elderly patients with advanced colorectal cancer. This article reviews current optimal first-line treatment strategies for elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Meulenbeld","given":"Dr Hielke J."},{"family":"Creemers","given":"Geert-Jan"}],"citation-key":"meulenbeldFirstLine2007","container-title":"Drugs & Aging","container-title-short":"Drugs Aging","DOI":"10.2165/00002512-200724030-00004","ISSN":"1170-229X, 1179-1969","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"223-238","source":"link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca","title":"First-Line Treatment Strategies for Elderly Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/article/10.2165/00002512-200724030-00004","volume":"24"},

This process is well understood where the emerging species are spatially isolated from one another. But the process of sympatric speciation—where the diverging species co-occur—is more enigmatic. Bacterial viruses make good models for addressing such questions because of their rapid generation times. Meyer et al. took bacteriophage λ and grew it on a mix of two strains of Escherichia coli. The virus duly split its host preferences into lineages with differing affinity for their respective E. coli hosts. In some experiments, the phages diverged to the extent that they became reproductively restricted to one strain of E. coli, even when the other was present.\nScience, this issue p. 1301\nUnderstanding the conditions that allow speciation to occur is difficult because most research has focused on either long-lived organisms or asexual microorganisms. We propagated bacteriophage λ, a virus with rapid generations and frequent recombination, on two Escherichia coli host genotypes that expressed either the LamB or OmpF receptor. When supplied with either single host (allopatry), phage λ improved its binding to the available receptor while losing its ability to use the alternative. When evolving on both hosts together (sympatry), the viruses split into two lineages with divergent receptor preferences. Although the level of divergence varied among replicates, some lineages evolved reproductive isolation via genetic incompatibilities. This outcome indicates that, under suitable conditions, allopatric and sympatric speciation can occur with similar ease.\nA viral diversification experiment reveals rapid and repeatable speciation.\nA viral diversification experiment reveals rapid and repeatable speciation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"Justin R."},{"family":"Dobias","given":"Devin T."},{"family":"Medina","given":"Sarah J."},{"family":"Servilio","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Animesh"},{"family":"Lenski","given":"Richard E."}],"citation-key":"meyerEcological2016","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aai8446","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6317","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,9]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science","page":"1301-1304","PMID":"27884940","source":"science.sciencemag.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca","title":"Ecological speciation of bacteriophage lambda in allopatry and sympatry","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://science.sciencemag.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/content/354/6317/1301","volume":"354"},

Thus, efficient numerical solution approaches must be able to handle huge, possibly infinite and stiff systems of differential equations efficiently.

Packard examined the frequency of evolved CA rules as a function of Langton's lambda parameter (Langton, 1990), and interpreted the results of his experiment as giving evidence for the following two hypotheses: (1) CA rules able to perform complex computations are most likely to be found near ``critical'' lambda values, which have been claimed to correlate with a phase transition between ordered and chaotic behavioral regimes for CA; (2) When CA rules are evolved to perform a complex computation, evolution will tend to select rules with lambda values close to the critical values. Our experiment produced very different results, and we suggest that the interpretation of the original results is not correct. We also review and discuss issues related to lambda, dynamical-behavior classes, and computation in CA.

A sex-ratio allele is expressed in the heterogametic sex only, so that assumptions of Fisher's analysis do not apply. Sex-ratio evolution drives cultural evolution of a group-associated trait governing mortality in the homogametic sex. The two-sex dynamics under resource limitation induces a strong Allee effect that depends on both sex ratio and cultural trait values. We describe the resulting threshold, separating extinction from positive growth, as a function of female and male densities. When initial conditions avoid extinction due to the Allee effect, different sex ratios cannot coexist; in our model, greater female allocation always invades and excludes a lesser allocation. But the culturally transmitted trait interacts with the sex ratio to determine the the ecological consequences of successful invasion. The invading female allocation may permit population persistence at self-regulated equilibrium. For this case, the resident culture may be excluded, or may coexist with the invader culture. That is, a single sex-ratio allele in females and a cultural dimorphism in male mortality can persist; a low-mortality resident trait is maintained by father-to-son cultural transmission. Otherwise, the successfully invading female allocation excludes the resident allele and culture, and then drives the population to extinction via a shortage of males. Finally, we show that the results obtained under homogeneous mixing hold, with caveats, in a spatially explicit model with local mating and diffusive dispersal in both sexes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Molnar Jr.","given":"F."},{"family":"Caraco","given":"T."},{"family":"Korniss","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"molnarjr.Extraordinary2012","container-title":"arXiv:1206.1311","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,6]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Extraordinary Sex Ratios: Cultural Effects on Ecological Consequences","title-short":"Extraordinary Sex Ratios","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1311"},

It has been extensively studied in order to understand the emergence of complexity and diversity from a set of local rules. More recently, the capability of GL to self-oranize into a critical state has opened an interesting debate. In this work we adopt a different approach: by introducing stochastic rules in the GL it is found that ‘‘life’’ exhibits a very rich critical behavior. Discontinuous (first-order) irreversible phase transitions (IPT’s) between an extinct phase and a steady state supporting life are found. A precise location of the critical edge is achieved by means of an epidemic analysis, which also allows us to determine dynamic critical exponents. Furthermore, by means of a damage spreading study we conclude that the living phase is chaotic. The edge of the frozen-chaotic transition coincides with that of the IPT’s life extinction. Close to the edge, fractal spreading of the damage is observed; however, deep inside the living phase such spreading becomes homogeneous.

However, challenges in implementation have prevented its widespread use. Leveraging the process of comparative judgement has the potential to facilitate peer feedback and assessment at scale. Performing an active comparative process facilitates students’ future learning by enabling them to go beyond identifying superficial features of a phenomenon (Bransford,1999; Schwartz,1998). Developing the capacity in students to be an effective ‘assessor of learning’ prepares students for lifelong learning by preparing them to make complex judgements about their own work, as well as that of their peers (Boud, 2006).\n\nComPAIR is an adaptive comparative judgement (ACJ)-based online learning tool that facilitates peer feedback at scale (Potter, 2017) and has recently been proposed as reliable in assessing complex items (Pollitt, 2012). Learners evaluate, comment upon, and rank pairs of submissions in many classroom contexts across disciplines (English, Mathematics, Integrated Sciences, and Physics courses for this study). In previous work, particularly in the English and Physics cohorts, students found the tool intuitive to use and reported very strong perceptions of improved ability and confidence in their ability to complete a similar task in future or to begin a more complex related task. Students perceive ComPAIR as an effective tool for teaching and learning (Potter, 2017). Others have shown that feedback from multiple peers led to more significant improvements in revised papers than feedback provided by experts (Cho, 2007).\n\nIn addition to the cognitive benefits of assessing peer assignments and providing feedback, ComPAIR may reduce marking load and increase consistency (Pollitt, 2012). English (ENGL110; 150 students) and Integrated Sciences (ISCI360; 44 students) were used to evaluate ComPAIR for grading. Each student in ENGL110 judged three pairs of submissions on one criterion and ISCI360 students assessed six pairs on three criteria. Expert judgements on the same submissions were also made in ComPAIR to evaluate the reliability of the tool. The assignments were also manually graded by two teaching assistants. Simulation data suggest that the effect of ‘misjudgements’ has a large impact tool reliability, especially with a limited amount of judgements. In this presentation we will share results of our study using ComPAIR as a tool for assessment, and provide evidence-based practices for using ComPAIR in the classroom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Moosvi","given":"Firas"}],"citation-key":"moosviComPAIR2018","contributor":[{"family":"Blok","given":"Hendrik J.

Relying on results from Random Matrix Theory, we argue that such networks generically become unstable when their size increases, or when the heterogeneity in productivities/connectivities becomes too strong. At marginal stability and for large heterogeneities, we find that the distribution of firm sizes develops a power-law tail, as observed empirically. Crises can be triggered by small idiosyncratic shocks, which lead to \"avalanches\" of defaults characterized by a power-law distribution of total output losses. We conjecture that evolutionary and behavioural forces conspire to keep the economy close to marginal stability.

Many researchers have suggested that laptop note taking is less effective than longhand note taking for learning. Prior studies have primarily focused on students’ capacity for multitasking and distraction when using laptops. The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand.

The main component is a self-consistency relation for the time dependent maximal power output. The analytic approach presented here is the first to derive the observed logarithmic scaling between world (and other) record running speeds and times from basic principles of metabolic power supply. Various female and male record performances (world, national) and also personal best performances of individual runners for distances from 800m to the marathon are excellently described by this model, with mean errors of (often much) less than 1%. The model defines endurance in a way that demonstrates symmetry between long and short racing events that are separated by a characteristic time scale comparable to the time over which a runner can sustain maximal oxygen uptake.

We then refine the model to introduce a latent period of zombification, whereby humans are infected, but not infectious, before becoming undead. We then modify the model to include the effects of possible quarantine or a cure. Finally, we examine the impact of regular, impulsive reductions in the number of zombies and derive conditions under which eradication can occur.

Both models describe the time evolution of infectious diseases in networks whose vertices are either susceptible (S) or infected (I) agents. Precise estimation for disease spreading is one of the major goals in epidemic studies but often restricted to heavy numerical simulations. Analytic methods using operatorial content are subject to the asymmetric eigenvalue problem, limiting the use of perturbative methods. Numerical methods are limited to small populations, since the vector space increases exponentially with population size N. Here, we propose the use of the squared norm of the probability vector to obtain an algebraic equation, which permits the evaluation of stationary states in Markov processes. The equation requires the eigenvalues of symmetrized time generators and takes full advantage of symmetries, reducing the time evolution to an O(N) sparse problem. The calculation of eigenvalues employs quantum many-body techniques, while the standard perturbation theory accounts for small modifications to the network topology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Gilberto M."},{"family":"Monteiro","given":"Ana Carolina P."},{"family":"Cardoso","given":"George C."},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Alexandre S."}],"citation-key":"nakamuraEfficient2017","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/srep40885","ISSN":"2045-2322","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,20]]},"language":"en","license":"2017 Nature Publishing Group","page":"40885","source":"www.nature.com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca","title":"Efficient method for comprehensive computation of agent-level epidemic dissemination in networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep40885","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"nowakEmergence2004","abstract":"To explain the evolution of cooperation by natural selection has been a major goal of biologists since Darwin. Cooperators help others at a cost to themselves, while defectors receive the benefits of altruism without providing any help in return. The standard game dynamical formulation is the 'Prisoner's Dilemma'1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, in which two players have a choice between cooperation and defection. In the repeated game, cooperators using direct reciprocity cannot be exploited by defectors, but it is unclear how such cooperators can arise in the first place12, 13, 14, 15. In general, defectors are stable against invasion by cooperators. This understanding is based on traditional concepts of evolutionary stability and dynamics in infinite populations16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Here we study evolutionary game dynamics in finite populations21, 22, 23, 24, 25. We show that a single cooperator using a strategy like 'tit-for-tat' can invade a population of defectors with a probability that corresponds to a net selective advantage. We specify the conditions required for natural selection to favour the emergence of cooperation and define evolutionary stability in finite populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Nowak","given":"Martin A."},{"family":"Sasaki","given":"Akira"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Fudenberg","given":"Drew"}],"citation-key":"nowakEmergence2004","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature02414","ISSN":"0028-0836","issue":"6983","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",4,8]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2004 Nature Publishing Group","page":"646-650","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Emergence of cooperation and evolutionary stability in finite populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v428/n6983/abs/nature02414.html","volume":"428"},

  {"id":"nowakEvolutionary2006","abstract":"At a time of unprecedented expansion in the life sciences, evolution is the one theory that transcends all of biology. Any observation of a living system must ultimately be interpreted in the context of its evolution. Evolutionary change is the consequence of mutation and natural selection, which are two concepts that can be described by mathematical equations. Evolutionary Dynamics is concerned with these equations of life. In this book, Martin A. Nowak draws on the languages of biology and mathematics to outline the mathematical principles according to which life evolves. His work introduces readers to the powerful yet simple laws that govern the evolution of living systems, no matter how complicated they might seem. Evolution has become a mathematical theory, Nowak suggests, and any idea of an evolutionary process or mechanism should be studied in the context of the mathematical equations of evolutionary dynamics. His book presents a range of analytical tools that can be used to this end: fitness landscapes, mutation matrices, genomic sequence space, random drift, quasispecies, replicators, the Prisoner’s Dilemma, games in finite and infinite populations, evolutionary graph theory, games on grids, evolutionary kaleidoscopes, fractals, and spatial chaos. Nowak then shows how evolutionary dynamics applies to critical real-world problems, including the progression of viral diseases such as AIDS, the virulence of infectious agents, the unpredictable mutations that lead to cancer, the evolution of altruism, and even the evolution of human language. His book makes a clear and compelling case for understanding every living system—and everything that arises as a consequence of living systems—in terms of evolutionary dynamics.","author":[{"family":"Nowak","given":"Martin A."}],"citation-key":"nowakEvolutionary2006","edition":"1 edition","event-place":"Cambridge, Mass","ISBN":"978-0-674-02338-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",9,29]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"384","publisher":"Belknap Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Mass","source":"Amazon","title":"Evolutionary Dynamics: Exploring the Equations of Life","title-short":"Evolutionary Dynamics","type":"book"},

The proposer suggests how to split the sum. The responder can accept or reject the deal. If the deal is rejected, neither player gets anything. The rational solution, suggested by game theory, is for the proposer to offer the smallest possible share and for the responder to accept it. If humans play the game, however, the most frequent outcome is a fair share. In this paper, we develop an evolutionary approach to the Ultimatum Game.

  {"id":"nowakSpatial1994","abstract":"The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) is a widely employed metaphor for problems associated with the evolution of cooperative behavior. We have recently proposed an alternative approach to the PD, by exploring \"spatial games\" in which players--who are either pure cooperators, C, or pure defectors, D--interact with neighbors in some spatial array; in each generation, players add up the scores from all encounters, and in the next generation a given cell is retained by its previous owner or taken over by a neighbor, depending on who has the largest score. Over a wide range of the relevant parameters, we find that C and D persist together indefinitely (without any of the complex strategies that remember past encounters, and anticipate future ones, which characterize essentially all previous work on the iterated PD). Our earlier work, however, dealt with symmetric spatial lattices in two dimensions, deterministic winning and discrete time. We show here that the essential results remain valid in more realistic situations where the spatial distributions of cells are random in two or three dimensions, and where winning is partly probabilistic (rather than being determined by the largest local total). The essential results also remain valid (pace Huberman and Glance [Huberman, B. A. & Glance, N. S. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the understanding of science’s way of knowing does increase through academic ranks, indicating that the extended overall academic experience better accounts for increasing such thinking capacity than do science courses alone. Higher mean institutional SLCI scores correlate closely with increased institutional selectivity, as measured by the institutions’ higher mean SAT and ACT scores.

  {"id":"obrienHow2015","abstract":"Social justice concerns but also perceived business advantage are behind a widespread drive to increase workplace diversity. However, dominance in terms of ethnicity, gender or other aspects of diversity has been resistant to change in many sectors. The different factors which contribute to low diversity are often hotly contested and difficult to untangle. We propose that many of the barriers to change arise from self-reinforcing feedbacks between low group diversity and inclusivity. Using a dynamic model, we demonstrate how bias in employee appointment and departure can trap organizations in a state with much lower diversity than the applicant pool: a workforce diversity “poverty trap”. Our results also illustrate that if turnover rate is low, employee diversity takes a very long time to change, even in the absence of any bias. The predicted rate of change in workforce composition depends on the rate at which employees enter and leave the organization, and on three measures of inclusion: applicant diversity, appointment bias and departure bias. Quantifying these three inclusion measures is the basis of a new, practical framework to identify barriers and opportunities to increasing workforce diversity. Because we used a systems approach to investigate underlying feedback mechanisms rather than context-specific causes of low workforce diversity, our results are applicable across a wide range of settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Brien","given":"Katherine R."},{"family":"Scheffer","given":"Marten"},{"family":"Nes","given":"Egbert H.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Romy","non-dropping-particle":"van der"}],"citation-key":"obrienHow2015","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0133208","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7,28]]},"PMCID":"PMC4517751","PMID":"26217957","source":"PubMed Central","title":"How to Break the Cycle of Low Workforce Diversity: A Model for Change","title-short":"How to Break the Cycle of Low Workforce Diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4517751/","volume":"10"},

More recently, radiocarbon data have been used for a similar study [A. Ruzmaikin, J. Feynmann, and P. Robinson, Sol.

An important biological aspect of these studies is discerning which selection pressures favor the evolution of grouping behavior. In the past decade, researchers have begun using evolutionary computation to study the evolutionary effects of these selection pressures in predator-prey models. The selfish herd hypothesis states that concentrated groups arise because prey selfishly attempt to place their conspecifics between themselves and the predator, thus causing an endless cycle of movement toward the center of the group. Using an evolutionary model of a predator-prey system, we show that how predators attack is critical to the evolution of the selfish herd. Following this discovery, we show that density-dependent predation provides an abstraction of Hamilton's original formulation of \"domains of danger.\" Finally, we verify that density-dependent predation provides a sufficient selective advantage for prey to evolve the selfish herd in response to predation by coevolving predators. Thus, our work corroborates Hamilton's selfish herd hypothesis in a digital evolutionary model, refines the assumptions of the selfish herd hypothesis, and generalizes the domain of danger concept to density-dependent predation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Olson","given":"Randal S."},{"family":"Knoester","given":"David B."},{"family":"Adami","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"olsonEvolution2013","genre":"arXiv e-print","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,22]]},"number":"1310.6012","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Evolution of swarming behavior is shaped by how predators attack","type":"report","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6012"},

If Y=log <sub>e</sub>[P(t+τ)/P<sub>0</sub>(t)], where P(t+τ) and P<sub>0</sub>(t) are the price of the same random choice stock at random times t+τ and t, then the steady state distribution function of Y is <tex-math>$\\varphi (Y)=\\exp (-Y^{2}/2\\sigma ^{2}\\tau)/\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma ^{2}\\tau}$</tex-math>, which is precisely the probability distribution for a particle in Brownian motion, if σ is the dispersion developed at the end of unit time. A similar distribution holds for the value of money, measured approximately by stock-market indices. Sufficient, but not necessary conditions to derive this distribution quantitatively are given by the conditions of trading, and the Weber-Fechner law. A consequence of the distribution function is that the expectation values for price itself E(P)=∫<sub>0</sub><sup>∞</sup>P φ (Y)(dY/dP) dP increases, with increasing time interval τ , at a rate of 3 to 5 per cent per year, with increasing fluctuation, or dispersion, of P. This secular increase has nothing to do with long-term inflation, or the growth of assets in a capitalistic economy, since the expected reciprocal of price, or number of shares purchasable in the future, per dollar, increases with τ in an identical fashion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Osborne","given":"M.

In seeking to answer fundamental questions about how biological systems function and change over time, the modern biologist is as likely to rely on sophisticated mathematical and computer-based models as traditional fieldwork. In this book, Sarah Otto and Troy Day provide biology students with the tools necessary to both interpret models and to build their own.The book starts at an elementary level of mathematical modeling, assuming that the reader has had high school mathematics and first-year calculus. Otto and Day then gradually build in depth and complexity, from classic models in ecology and evolution to more intricate class-structured and probabilistic models. The authors provide primers with instructive exercises to introduce readers to the more advanced subjects of linear algebra and probability theory. Through examples, they describe how models have been used to understand such topics as the spread of HIV, chaos, the age structure of a country, speciation, and extinction.Ecologists and evolutionary biologists today need enough mathematical training to be able to assess the power and limits of biological models and to develop theories and models themselves. This innovative book will be an indispensable guide to the world of mathematical models for the next generation of biologists.A how-to guide for developing new mathematical models in biology Provides step-by-step recipes for constructing and analyzing models Interesting biological applications Explores classical models in ecology and evolution Questions at the end of every chapter Primers cover important mathematical topics Exercises with answers Appendixes summarize useful rules Labs and advanced material available","author":[{"family":"Otto","given":"Sarah P."},{"family":"Day","given":"Troy"}],"citation-key":"ottoBiologist2011","ISBN":"978-1-4008-4091-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"746","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"A Biologist's Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution","type":"book"},

In biology, theories are often formalized in the form of mathematical models, which may render them inaccessible to those lacking mathematical training. In the present article, we consider how theories could be presented to better aid understanding.

We classify these recommendations into two classes: those that increase the links between new and existing information and those that reduce unnecessary or irrelevant complexities. For each, we provide concrete examples to illustrate the scenarios in which they apply. By enhancing a reader's familiarity with the material, these recommendations lower the mental capacity required to learn new information. Our hope is that these recommendations can provide a pathway for theoreticians to increase the accessibility of their work and for empiricists to engage with theory, strengthening the feedback between theory and experimentation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ou","given":"William J-A"},{"family":"Henriques","given":"Gil J B"},{"family":"Senthilnathan","given":"Athmanathan"},{"family":"Ke","given":"Po-Ju"},{"family":"Grainger","given":"Tess N"},{"family":"Germain","given":"Rachel M"}],"citation-key":"ouWriting2022","container-title":"BioScience","container-title-short":"BioScience","DOI":"10.1093/biosci/biab133","ISSN":"0006-3568","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"page":"300-313","source":"Silverchair","title":"Writing Accessible Theory in Ecology and Evolution: Insights from Cognitive Load Theory","title-short":"Writing Accessible Theory in Ecology and Evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biab133","volume":"72"},

  {"id":"pennTemperaturedependent2018","abstract":"Drivers of the “Great Dying”\nThough our current extinction crisis is substantial, it pales in comparison to the largest extinction in Earth's history, which occurred at the end of the Permian Period. Referred to as the “Great Dying,” this event saw the loss of up to 96% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial species. Penn et al. explored the extinction dynamics of the time using Earth system models in conjunction with physiological data across animal taxa (see the Perspective by Kump). They conclude that increased marine temperatures and reduced oxygen availability were responsible for a majority of the recorded extinctions. Because similar environmental alterations are predicted outcomes of current climate change, we would be wise to take note.\nScience, this issue p. eaat1327; see also p. 1113\nStructured Abstract\nINTRODUCTIONClimate change triggered by volcanic greenhouse gases is hypothesized to have caused the largest mass extinction in Earth’s history at the end of the Permian Period (~252 million years ago). Geochemical evidence provides strong support for rapid global warming and accompanying ocean oxygen (O2) loss, but a quantitative link among climate, species’ traits, and extinction is lacking. To test whether warming and O2 loss can mechanistically account for the marine mass extinction, we combined climate model simulations with an established ecophysiological framework to predict the biogeographic patterns and severity of extinction. Those predictions were confirmed by a spatially explicit analysis of the marine fossil record.\nRATIONALEThe impact of climate change on marine biodiversity depends on both its magnitude and on species’ diverse biological sensitivities. Tolerances of marine animals to warming and O2 loss are physiologically related and can be represented in a single metric: the ratio of temperature-dependent O2 supply and demand rates. This ratio, termed the Metabolic Index (Φ), measures the environmental scope for aerobic activity and is governed by ocean conditions as well as thermal and hypoxia sensitivity traits that vary across species. If climate warming and O2 loss reduce Φ below the species-specific minimum requirement for sustained ecological activity (Φcrit), the ocean would no longer support active aerobic metabolism and, by extension, long-term population persistence.\nRESULTSWe simulated the greenhouse gas–driven global warming at the end of the Permian using a model of Earth’s climate and coupled biogeochemical cycles that matches geochemical proxy data. The imposed increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas levels raises near-surface ocean temperatures by more than ~10°C and depletes global marine O2 levels by almost 80%.To predict the impact of these changes on animal habitat and survival, we measured the frequencies of Metabolic Index traits in diverse living species and used them to define a set of model ecophysiotypes. We populated the model Permian ocean with each ecophysiotype wherever conditions provide viable habitat (Φ ≥ Φcrit), yielding an ocean with diverse, locally adapted ecophysiotypes throughout all regions. Across the climate transition, however, ocean warming increases the metabolic O2 demand amid declining supply; this removes large fractions of global aerobic habitat for the vast majority of ecophysiotypes and implies a high likelihood of extinction. We simulated the resulting mass extinction of ecophysiotypes and found a robust geographic pattern: Extinction intensity should have been lower in the tropics than at high latitudes. The cause of lower tropical extinction is that organisms initially inhabiting these warm, low-O2 environments can better exploit those conditions when they arise globally, whereas the habitats of more polar species disappear completely.To test the geographic selectivity of the model extinction, we compared model predictions to spatially explicit reconstructions of genus extinction from the marine fossil record. We found that across diverse taxonomic groups, the observed extinction intensity indeed increases with latitude, consistent with the predicted signature of aerobic habitat loss. Comparison of the model to the fossil record implies that temperature-dependent hypoxia can account for more than half of the observed magnitude of regional extinction (i.e., extirpation).\nCONCLUSIONOcean warming and O2 loss simulated in an Earth System Model of end-Permian climate change imply widespread loss of aerobic habitat among animal types with diverse thermal and hypoxia tolerances. The resulting extinctions are predicted to select most strongly against higher-latitude species, whose biogeographic niche disappears globally. The combined physiological stresses of ocean warming and O2 loss largely account for the spatial pattern and magnitude of extinction observed in the fossil record of the “Great Dying.” These results highlight the future extinction risk arising from a depletion of the ocean’s aerobic capacity that is already under way. <img class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\" src=\"http://science.sciencemag.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/content/sci/362/6419/eaat1327/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Schematic illustration of temperature-dependent hypoxia as a driver of the end-Permian marine mass extinction.Greenhouse gas forcing in a model of Earth’s climate at the end of the Permian drives ocean warming (contours) and oxygen loss that match geochemical proxy data.

WHITE (CHAMBERED NAUTILUS)\nRapid climate change at the end of the Permian Period (~252 million years ago) is the hypothesized trigger for the largest mass extinction in Earth’s history. We present model simulations of the Permian/Triassic climate transition that reproduce the ocean warming and oxygen (O2) loss indicated by the geologic record. The effect of these changes on animal survival is evaluated using the Metabolic Index (Φ), a measure of scope for aerobic activity governed by organismal traits sampled in diverse modern species. Modeled loss of aerobic habitat predicts lower extinction intensity in the tropics, a pattern confirmed with a spatially explicit analysis of the marine fossil record. The combined physiological stresses of ocean warming and O2 loss can account for more than half the magnitude of the “Great Dying.”\nIncreased temperature and reduced oxygen drove extinctions during the “Great Dying” about 252 million years ago.\nIncreased temperature and reduced oxygen drove extinctions during the “Great Dying” about 252 million years ago.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Penn","given":"Justin L."},{"family":"Deutsch","given":"Curtis"},{"family":"Payne","given":"Jonathan L."},{"family":"Sperling","given":"Erik A."}],"citation-key":"pennTemperaturedependent2018","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aat1327","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6419","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,7]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

This book brings together pre-eminent scholars from Australia, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and the USA to critically assess teaching and learning issues that cut across most disciplines. In addressing long-standing and newly emerging issues, the researchers examine the scientific evidence on what constitutes effective teaching in college classrooms, on the psychometric integrity of measures of teaching effectiveness, and on the use of such measures for tenure, promotion, and salary decisions. Systematically explored throughout the book is the avowed linkage between classroom teaching and motivation, learning, and performance outcomes in students. In so doing, the book deals with the nexus between knowledge production by researchers and knowledge utility for end-users made up of classroom instructors, department heads, deans, directors, and policymakers. The book will appeal to researchers interested in teaching and learning, faculty members developing evidence-based pedagogical practices, academic administrators and policymakers responsible for instituting teaching and learning protocols, and faculty development officers promoting the effective teaching practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,11]]},"citation-key":"perryScholarship2007","editor":[{"family":"Perry","given":"Raymond P."},{"family":"Smart","given":"John C."}],"ISBN":"978-1-4020-4944-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","source":"www.springer.com","title":"The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education: An Evidence-Based Perspective","title-short":"The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education","type":"book","URL":"https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781402049446"},

We consider an elementary one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) with deterministic limits given by the quiescent rule 0, the rule 72 that evolves into a non-trivial fixed point, and the chaotic rules 18 and 90. Despite the simplicity of the rules, the PCA shows a surprising number of transition phenomena.

Classic decision theory transforms money into utility through a utility function and defines the value of a gamble as the expectation value of utility changes. Utility functions aim to capture individual psychological characteristics, but their generality limits predictive power. Expectation value maximizers are defined as rational in economics, but expectation values are only meaningful in the presence of ensembles or in systems with ergodic properties, whereas decision-makers have no access to ensembles, and the variables representing wealth in the usual growth models do not have the relevant ergodic properties. Simultaneously addressing the shortcomings of utility and those of expectations, we propose to evaluate gambles by averaging wealth growth over time. No utility function is needed, but a dynamic must be specified to compute time averages. Linear and logarithmic “utility functions” appear as transformations that generate ergodic observables for purely additive and purely multiplicative dynamics, respectively. We highlight inconsistencies throughout the development of decision theory, whose correction clarifies that our perspective is legitimate.

This is the rain-equivalent of the Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquakes. The event durations and the waiting times between events are also characterised by scaling regions, where no typical time scale exists. The Hurst exponent of the rain intensity signal $H = 0.76 > 0.5$. It is valid in the temporal range from minutes up to the full duration of the signal of half a year.

  {"id":"pineda-krchTale2007","abstract":"Periodic predator–prey dynamics in constant environments are usually taken as indicative of deterministic limit cycles. It is known, however, that demographic stochasticity in finite populations can also give rise to regular population cycles, even when the corresponding deterministic models predict a stable equilibrium. Specifically, such quasi-cycles are expected in stochastic versions of deterministic models exhibiting equilibrium dynamics with weakly damped oscillations. The existence of quasi-cycles substantially expands the scope for natural patterns of periodic population oscillations caused by ecological interactions, thereby complicating the conclusive interpretation of such patterns. Here we show how to distinguish between quasi-cycles and noisy limit cycles based on observing changing population sizes in predator–prey populations. We start by confirming that both types of cycle can occur in the individual-based version of a widely used class of deterministic predator–prey model. We then show that it is feasible and straightforward to accurately distinguish between the two types of cycle through the combined analysis of autocorrelations and marginal distributions of population sizes. Finally, by confronting these results with real ecological time series, we demonstrate that by using our methods even short and imperfect time series allow quasi-cycles and limit cycles to be distinguished reliably.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Pineda-Krch","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Blok","given":"Hendrik J.

Peter advanced an apparently paradoxical principle, named since then after him, which can be summarized as follows: ‘Every new member in a hierarchical organization climbs the hierarchy until he/she reaches his/her level of maximum incompetence’. Despite its apparent unreasonableness, such a principle would realistically act in any organization where the mechanism of promotion rewards the best members and where the competence at their new level in the hierarchical structure does not depend on the competence they had at the previous level, usually because the tasks of the levels are very different to each other. Here we show, by means of agent based simulations, that if the latter two features actually hold in a given model of an organization with a hierarchical structure, then not only is the Peter principle unavoidable, but also it yields in turn a significant reduction of the global efficiency of the organization. Within a game theory-like approach, we explore different promotion strategies and we find, counterintuitively, that in order to avoid such an effect the best ways for improving the efficiency of a given organization are either to promote each time an agent at random or to promote randomly the best and the worst members in terms of competence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pluchino","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Rapisarda","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Garofalo","given":"Cesare"}],"citation-key":"pluchinoPeter2010","container-title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","container-title-short":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.physa.2009.09.045","ISSN":"0378-4371","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2,1]]},"page":"467-472","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The Peter principle revisited: A computational study","title-short":"The Peter principle revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843710900822X","volume":"389"},

Both in sympatry and parapatry, they find that speciation occurs relatively easily. We reveal that in the sympatric clonal model, the equilibrium distribution is continuous and the disruptive selection driving evolution of discrete clusters is only transient. Hence, if discrete phenotypes are to remain stable in the sympatric sexual model, there should be some source of nontransient disruptive selection that will drive evolution of assortment. We analyze sexually reproducing populations using the Bulmer's infinitesimal model and show that cost-free assortment alone leads to speciation and disruptive selection only arises when the optimal distribution cannot be matched-in this example, because the phenotypic range is limited. In addition, Doebeli and Dieckmann's analyses assumed a high genetic variance and a high mutation rate. Thus, these theoretical models do not support the conclusion that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. In their parapatric model (Doebeli and Dieckmann 2003), clustering into distinct phenotypes is driven by edge effects, rather than by frequency-dependent competition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Polechová","given":"Jitka"},{"family":"Barton","given":"Nicholas H"}],"citation-key":"polechovaSpeciation2005","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb01771.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1194-1210","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Speciation Through Competition: A Critical Review","title-short":"Speciation Through Competition","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb01771.x/abstract","volume":"59"},

The ComPAIR application discussed in this article scaffolds peer feedback through comparisons, asking students to choose the “better” of two answers in a series of pairings offered in an engaging online context. In contrast to other peer-feedback approaches that seek to train novices to be able to provide expert feedback (such as calibrated peer review) or to crowdsource grading, ComPAIR focuses upon the benefits to be gained from the critical process of comparison and ranking. The tool design is based on the longstanding psychological principle of comparative judgement, by which novices who may not yet have the compass to assess others’ work confidently can still rank content as “better” with accuracy. Data from 168 students in pilot studies in English, Physics and Math courses at the University of British Columbia are reviewed. Though the use of ComPAIR required little classroom time, students perceived this approach to increase their facility with course content, their ability assess their own work, and their capacity to provide feedback on the work of others in a collaborative learning environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,5]]},"archive_location":"post-secondary students; introductory course; senior course","author":[{"family":"Potter","given":"Tiffany"},{"family":"Englund","given":"Letitia"},{"family":"Charbonneau","given":"James"},{"family":"MacLean","given":"Mark Thomson"},{"family":"Newell","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Roll","given":"Ido"}],"citation-key":"potterComPAIR2017","container-title":"Teaching & Learning Inquiry","DOI":"10.20343/teachlearninqu.5.2.8","ISSN":"2167-4787","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,25]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2017 Tiffany Potter, Letitia Englund, James Charbonneau, Mark Thomson MacLean, Jonathan Newell, Ido Roll","page":"89-113","source":"tlijournal.com","title":"ComPAIR: A New Online Tool Using Adaptive Comparative Judgement to Support Learning with Peer Feedback","title-short":"ComPAIR","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://tlijournal.com/tli/index.php/TLI/article/view/156","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"quayleModelling2006","abstract":"An evolutionary model of genetic regulatory networks is developed, based on a model of network encoding and dynamics called the Artificial Genome (AG). This model derives a number of specific genes and their interactions from a string of (initially random) bases in an idealized manner analogous to that employed by natural DNA. The gene expression dynamics are determined by updating the gene network as if it were a simple Boolean network. The generic behaviour of the AG model is investigated in detail. In particular, we explore the characteristic network topologies generated by the model, their dynamical behaviours, and the typical variance of network connectivities and network structures. These properties are demonstrated to agree with a probabilistic analysis of the model, and the typical network structures generated by the model are shown to lie between those of random networks and scale-free networks in terms of their degree distribution. Evolutionary processes are simulated using a genetic algorithm, with selection acting on a range of properties from gene number and degree of connectivity through periodic behaviour to specific patterns of gene expression. The evolvability of increasingly complex patterns of gene expression is examined in detail. When a degree of redundancy is introduced, the average number of generations required to evolve given targets is reduced, but limits on evolution of complex gene expression patterns remain. In addition, cyclic gene expression patterns with periods that are multiples of shorter expression patterns are shown to be inherently easier to evolve than others. Constraints imposed by the template-matching nature of the AG model generate similar biases towards such expression patterns in networks in initial populations, in addition to the somewhat scale-free nature of these networks. The significance of these results on current understanding of biological evolution is discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Quayle","given":"A.P."},{"family":"Bullock","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"quayleModelling2006","container-title":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.06.020","ISSN":"0022-5193","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",2,21]]},"page":"737-753","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Modelling the evolution of genetic regulatory networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251930500278X","volume":"238"},

However, this failure is not due to anything intrinsic to the inclusive-fitness viewpoint. It stems from an essentially quantitative genetic feature of the model, an attempt to separate fitness terms from genetic terms. A general rule is provided for determining when such a separation is justified. This rule is used to show how Price's covariance equation is related to standard quantitative genetic results and to derive quantitative genetic equations for inclusive fitness and group selection. It also shows that the group-selection model is no more general than the inclusive-fitness viewpoint. These models serve a role that is different from, but not inferior to, population-genetics models.

The human intestine houses a dense and diverse microbial community critical to health, yet we know little about cooperation within this important ecosystem. Here we test experimentally for evolved cooperation within the Bacteroidales, the dominant Gram-negative bacteria of the human intestine. We show that during growth on certain dietary polysaccharides, the model member Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron exhibits only limited cooperation. Although this organism digests these polysaccharides extracellularly, mutants lacking this ability are outcompeted. In contrast, we discovered a dedicated cross-feeding enzyme system in the prominent gut symbiont Bacteroides ovatus, which digests polysaccharide at a cost to itself but at a benefit to another species. Using in vitro systems and gnotobiotic mouse colonization models, we find that extracellular digestion of inulin increases the fitness of B. ovatus owing to reciprocal benefits when it feeds other gut species such as Bacteroides vulgatus. This is a rare example of naturally-evolved cooperation between microbial species.

  {"id":"raoStochastic2003","abstract":"Biochemical dynamics are often determined by series of single molecule events such as gene expression and reactions involving protein concentrations at nanomolar concentrations. Molecular fluctuations, consequently, may be of biological significance. For example, heterogeneity in clonal populations is believed to arise from molecular fluctuations in gene expression. A realistic description, therefore, requires a probabilistic description of the biochemical dynamics as deterministic descriptions cannot capture the inherent molecular fluctuations. The Gillespie algorithm [D. T. Gillespie, J. Phys. Chem. 81, 2350 (1977)] is a stochastic procedure for simulating chemical systems at low concentrations. A limitation of stochastic kinetic models is that they require detailed information about the chemical kinetics often unavailable in biological systems. Furthermore, the Gillespie algorithm is computationally intensive when there are many molecules and reaction events. In this article, we explore one approximation technique, well known in deterministic kinetics, for simplifying the stochastic model: the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA). We illustrate how the QSSA can be applied to the Gillespie algorithm. Using the QSSA, we derive stochastic Michaelis–Menten rate expressions for simple enzymatic reactions and illustrate how the QSSA is applied when modeling and simulating a simple genetic circuit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Rao","given":"Christopher V."},{"family":"Arkin","given":"Adam P."}],"citation-key":"raoStochastic2003","container-title":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.1545446","ISSN":"0021-9606, 1089-7690","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",2,28]]},"page":"4999-5010","source":"scitation.aip.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca","title":"Stochastic chemical kinetics and the quasi-steady-state assumption: Application to the Gillespie algorithm","title-short":"Stochastic chemical kinetics and the quasi-steady-state assumption","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://scitation.aip.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/content/aip/journal/jcp/118/11/10.1063/1.1545446","volume":"118"},

A Systems Biology approach that combines quantitative experimental data with dynamic mathematical modeling promises to yield deeper insights into these processes. Nevertheless, with growing complexity and increasing amount of quantitative experimental data, building realistic and reliable mathematical models can become a challenging task: the quality of experimental data has to be assessed objectively, unknown model parameters need to be estimated from the experimental data, and numerical calculations need to be precise and efficient.Here, we discuss, compare and characterize the performance of computational methods throughout the process of quantitative dynamic modeling using two previously established examples, for which quantitative, dose- and time-resolved experimental data are available. In particular, we present an approach that allows to determine the quality of experimental data in an efficient, objective and automated manner. Using this approach data generated by different measurement techniques and even in single replicates can be reliably used for mathematical modeling. For the estimation of unknown model parameters, the performance of different optimization algorithms was compared systematically. Our results show that deterministic derivative-based optimization employing the sensitivity equations in combination with a multi-start strategy based on latin hypercube sampling outperforms the other methods by orders of magnitude in accuracy and speed. Finally, we investigated transformations that yield a more efficient parameterization of the model and therefore lead to a further enhancement in optimization performance.

Extinction may be episodic at all scales, with relatively long periods of stability alternating with short-lived extinction events. Most extinction episodes are biologically selective, and further analysis of the victims and survivors offers the greatest chance of deducing the proximal causes of extinction. A drop in sea level and climatic change are most frequently invoked to explain mass extinctions, but new theories of collisions with extraterrestrial bodies are gaining favor.

They emphasize the individual patient evaluation and the process of aging, with references to other feline practice guidelines for a more complete discussion of specific diseases. Focusing on each cat encourages and empowers the owner to become a part of the cat’s care every step of the way. A comprehensive discussion during the physical examination and history taking allows for tailoring the approach to both the cat and the family involved in the care. Videos and analysis of serial historical measurements are brought into the assessment of each patient. These Guidelines introduce the emerging concept of frailty, with a description and methods of its incorporation into the senior cat assessment. Minimum database diagnostics are discussed, along with recommendations for additional investigative considerations. For example, blood pressure assessment is included as a minimum diagnostic procedure in both apparently healthy and ill cats. Cats age at a much faster rate than humans, so practical timelines for testing frequency are included and suggest an increased frequency of diagnostics with advancing age. The importance of nutrition, as well as senior cat nutritional needs and deficiencies, is considered. Pain is highlighted as its own syndrome, with an emphasis on consideration in every senior cat. The Task Force discusses anesthesia, along with strategies to allow aging cats to be safely anesthetized well into their senior years. The medical concept of quality of life is addressed with the latest information available in veterinary medicine. This includes end of life considerations like palliative and hospice care, as well as recommendations on the establishment of ‘budgets of care’, which greatly influence what can be done for the individual cat. Acknowledgement is given that each cat owner will be different in this regard; and establishing what is reasonable and practical for the individual owner is important. A discussion on euthanasia offers some recommendations to help the owner make a decision that reflects the best interests of the individual cat.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ray","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Carney","given":"Hazel C"},{"family":"Boynton","given":"Beth"},{"family":"Quimby","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Robertson","given":"Sheilah"},{"family":"St Denis","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Tuzio","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Bonnie"}],"citation-key":"ray20212021","container-title":"Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery","container-title-short":"Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery","DOI":"10.1177/1098612X211021538","ISSN":"1098-612X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"613-638","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"2021 AAFP Feline Senior Care Guidelines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612X211021538","volume":"23"},

Dispersional analysis estimates H by using the variance of the grouped means of discrete fractional Gaussian noise series (DfGn). Scaled windowed variance analysis estimates H using the mean of grouped variances of discrete fractional Brownian motion (DfBm) series. Both dispersional analysis and scaled windowed variance analysis have small bias and variance in their estimates of the Hurst coefficient. This study demonstrates that both methods derive their accuracy from their strict mathematical relationship to the expected value of the correlation function of DfGn. The expected values of the variance of the grouped means for dispersional analysis on DfGn and the mean of the grouped variance for scaled windowed variance analysis on DfBm are calculated. An improved formulation for scaled windowed variance analysis is given. The expected values using these analyses on the wrong kind of series (dispersional analysis on DfBm and scaled windowed variance analysis on DfGn) are also calculated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Raymond","given":"Gary M."},{"family":"Bassingthwaighte","given":"James B."}],"citation-key":"raymondDeriving1999","container-title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","DOI":"10.1016/S0378-4371(98)00479-8","ISSN":"0378-4371","issue":"1–2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",3,15]]},"page":"85-96","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Deriving dispersional and scaled windowed variance analyses using the correlation function of discrete fractional Gaussian noise","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437198004798","volume":"265"},

  {"id":"reiaConway2014","abstract":"Conway's cellular automaton Game of Life has been conjectured to be a critical (or quasicritical) dynamical system. This criticality is generally seen as a continuous order-disorder transition in cellular automata (CA) rule space. Life's mean-field return map predicts an absorbing vacuum phase (ρ=0) and an active phase density, with ρ=0.37, which contrasts with Life's absorbing states in a square lattice, which have a stationary density of ρ2D≈0.03. Here, we study and classify mean-field maps for 6144 outer-totalistic CA and compare them with the corresponding behavior found in the square lattice. We show that the single-site mean-field approach gives qualitative (and even quantitative) predictions for most of them. The transition region in rule space seems to correspond to a nonequilibrium discontinuous absorbing phase transition instead of a continuous order-disorder one. We claim that Life is a quasicritical nucleation process where vacuum phase domains invade the alive phase. Therefore, Life is not at the “border of chaos,” but thrives on the “border of extinction.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",7,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Reia","given":"Sandro M."},{"family":"Kinouchi","given":"Osame"}],"citation-key":"reiaConway2014","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

These models, as for instance Verhulst, Gompertz and Bertalanffy models, are posted in such a manner that all the parameters involved have physical interpretation. A model based on the interaction (distance dependent) between the individuals (microscopic level) is also presented. This microscopic model reachs the phenomenological models presented as particular cases. In this approach, the Verhulst model represents the situation in which all the individuals interact in the same way, regardless of the distance between them. That means Verhulst model is a kind of mean field model. The other phenomenological models are reaching from the microscopic model according to two quantities: i) the relation between the way that the interaction decays with the distance; and ii) the dimension of the spatial structure formed by the population. This microscopic model allows understanding population growth by first principles, because it predicts that some phenomenological models can be seen as a consequence of the same individual level kind of interaction. In this sense, the microscopic model that will be discussed here paves the way to finding universal patterns that are common to all types of growth, even in systems of very different nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Fabiano L."}],"citation-key":"ribeiroFirst2016","container-title":"arXiv:1605.06309 [q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,20]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"First Principles Attempt to Unify some Population Growth Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06309"},

  {"id":"ryserBone2016","abstract":"Bone remodeling is a complex process involving cell-cell interactions, biochemical signaling and mechanical stimuli. Early models of the biological aspects of remodeling were non-spatial and focused on the local dynamics at a fixed location in the bone. Several spatial extensions of these models have been proposed, but they generally suffer from two limitations: first, they are not amenable to analysis and are computationally expensive, and second, they neglect the role played by bone-embedded osteocytes. To address these issues, we developed a novel model of spatial remodeling based on the principles of evolutionary game theory. The analytically tractable framework describes the spatial interactions between zones of bone resorption, bone formation and quiescent bone, and explicitly accounts for regulation of remodeling by bone-embedded, mechanotransducing osteocytes. Using tools from the theory of interacting particle systems we systematically classified the different dynamic regimes of the spatial model and identified regions of parameter space that allow for coexistence of resorption, formation and quiescence, as observed in physiological remodeling. In coexistence scenarios, three-dimensional simulations revealed the emergence of sponge-like bone clusters. Comparison between spatial and non-spatial dynamics revealed substantial differences and suggested a stabilizing role of space. Our findings emphasize the importance of accounting for spatial structure and bone-embedded osteocytes when modeling the process of bone remodeling. Thanks to the lattice-based framework, the proposed model can easily be coupled to a mechanical model of bone loading.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Ryser","given":"Marc D."},{"family":"Murgas","given":"Kevin A."}],"citation-key":"ryserBone2016","container-title":"arXiv:1609.00620 [q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,2]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Bone Remodeling as a Spatial Evolutionary Game","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00620"},

  {"id":"samuelsonFallacy1971","abstract":"Because the outcomes of repeated investments or gambles involve products of variables, authorities have repeatedly been tempted to the belief that, in a long sequence, maximization of the expected value of terminal utility can be achieved or well-approximated by a strategy of maximizing at each stage the geometric mean of outcome (or its equivalent, the expected value of the logarithm of principal plus return). The law of large numbers or of the central limit theorem as applied to the logs can validate the conclusion that a maximum-geometric-mean strategy does indeed make it “virtually certain” that, in a “long” sequence, one will end with a higher terminal wealth and utility. However, this does not imply the false corollary that the geometric-mean strategy is optimal for any finite number of periods, however long, or that it becomes asymptotically a good approximation. As a trivial counter-example, it is shown that for utility proportional to xγ/γ, whenever γ ≠ 0, the geometric strategy is suboptimal for all T and never a good approximation. For utility bounded above, as when γ < 0, the same conclusion holds. If utility is bounded above and finite at zero wealth, no uniform strategy can be optimal, even though it can be that the best uniform strategy will be that of the maximum geometric mean. However, asymptotically the same level of utility can be reached by an infinity of nearby uniform strategies. The true optimum in the bounded case involves nonuniform strategies, usually being more risky than the geometric-mean maximizer's strategy at low wealths and less risky at high wealths. The novel criterion of maximizing the expected average compound return, which asymptotically leads to maximizing of geometric mean, is shown to be arbitrary.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Samuelson","given":"Paul A"}],"citation-key":"samuelsonFallacy1971","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["1971",10,1]]},"page":"2493-2496","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"The \"Fallacy\" of Maximizing the Geometric Mean in Long Sequences of Investing or Gambling","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/68/10/2493","volume":"68"},

  {"id":"sasidevanCooperation2015","abstract":"The conventional solution concept used for solving non-cooperative games is that of the Nash equilibrium - a strategy choice by each player so that no player can do better by deviating unilaterally from it. In this paper, we propose an alternative framework referred to as the co-action equilibrium for solving such games. This equilibrium is guaranteed to exist for all games having a symmetric payoff structure. It also has the advantage of being unique for a given game. We analyze in detail three well-known two-person single-stage games, viz., Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), Chicken and Stag Hunt, to illustrate the differences between Nash and co-action solutions. The latter, in general, lead to \"nicer\" strategies being selected by the agents resulting in globally more efficient outcomes. For example, the co-action equilibrium in PD corresponds to full cooperation among agents at lower values of temptation to defect, while for higher temptation each agent employs a probabilistic (or mixed) strategy, thus essentially solving the dilemma. The key idea underlying the co-action solution is that agents make independent choices from the possible actions available, taking into account that other agents will behave the same way as them and they are also aware of this. It defines a new benchmark strategy for agents in non-cooperative games which is very different from the existing ones. The concept can be generalized to game situations where the symmetry assumption does not hold across all agents by clustering players into different symmetry groups that results in a novel class of games.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Sasidevan","given":"V."},{"family":"Sinha","given":"Sitabhra"}],"citation-key":"sasidevanCooperation2015","container-title":"arXiv:1501.05145 [nlin, physics:physics]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,21]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Cooperation among rational agents in co-action equilibrium of Prisoner's Dilemma and other single-stage symmetric games","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05145"},

Much of the relevant clinical trial data focus on prostate cancer (PCa). We provide a nonsystematic review and our perspective on the available data.\nEvidence synthesis\nClinical manifestations can include pain, hypercalcemia, pathologic fractures, and spinal cord compression. Optimal systemic therapy for skeletal metastases often features a combination of disease-specific therapy and bone-targeted therapy. Some agents, such as the radiopharmaceutical radium-223, blur the line between those categories. Osteoclast inhibition is a validated strategy in the management of selected patients with bone metastases. Zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate, is approved for the prevention of skeletal events caused by solid tumors metastatic to bone. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inactivates receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand and is approved for the same indication. Beta-emitting radiopharmaceuticals can be effective for the palliation of pain caused by bone metastases, but their use is often limited by marrow suppression. The alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical radium-223 has recently been shown to improve overall survival and prevent skeletal events in select men with castration-resistant PCa metastatic to bone. Multiple ongoing clinical trials are designed to examine the potential for therapeutic inhibition of additional targets such as Src and hepatocyte growth factor (MET).\nConclusions\nBone metastases cause considerable morbidity and mortality among patients with genitourinary malignancies. Optimal management requires consideration of bone-targeted therapy as well as disease-specific therapy.

What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their sharpness, transitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their unpredictability, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we present an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a particular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, one can choose a metric which leads to the inference of an emergent ability or another metric which does not. Thus, our alternative suggests that existing claims of emergent abilities are creations of the researcher's analyses, not fundamental changes in model behavior on specific tasks with scale. We present our explanation in a simple mathematical model, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm three predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3 family on tasks with claimed emergent abilities, (2) make, test and confirm two predictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on BIG-Bench; and (3) show how similar metric decisions suggest apparent emergent abilities on vision tasks in diverse deep network architectures (convolutional, autoencoder, transformers).

The CLE's main disadvantage is its break down in finite time due to the problem of evaluating square roots of negative quantities whenever the molecule numbers become sufficiently small. We show that this issue is not a numerical integration problem, rather in many systems it is intrinsic to all representations of the CLE. Various methods of correcting the CLE have been proposed which avoid its break down. We show that these methods introduce undesirable artefacts in the CLE's predictions. In particular, for unimolecular systems, these correction methods lead to CLE predictions for the mean concentrations and variance of fluctuations which disagree with those of the chemical master equation. We show that, by extending the domain of the CLE to complex space, break down is eliminated, and the CLE's accuracy for unimolecular systems is restored. Although the molecule numbers are generally complex, we show that the \"complex CLE\" predicts real-valued quantities for the mean concentrations, the moments of intrinsic noise, power spectra and first passage times, hence admitting a physical interpretation. It is also shown to provide a more accurate approximation of the chemical master equation of simple biochemical circuits involving bimolecular reactions than the various corrected forms of the real-valued CLE, the linear-noise approximation and a commonly used two moment-closure approximation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schnoerr","given":"David"},{"family":"Sanguinetti","given":"Guido"},{"family":"Grima","given":"Ramon"}],"citation-key":"schnoerrComplex2014","container-title":"arXiv:1406.2502 [cond-mat, physics:physics, q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,10]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"The complex chemical Langevin equation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2502"},

Stronger correlations between consecutive steps in the updating order result in more, artificial structure in the patterns. Among these step–driven methods, using random choice with replacement to pick the next cell for updating, yields results that are least influenced by the updating method. We also analyse a time–driven method in which the state transitions of single cells are governed by a probability per unit time that determines an exponential distribution of the waiting time until the next transition. The statistical properties of this method are completely independent of the size of the grid. Consecutive updating steps therefore show no correlation at all.

It turns out that quite contrary, taking into account the actual individual/discrete character of the microscopic components of these systems is crucial for explaining their macroscopic behavior. In fact, we find that in conditions in which the continuum approach would predict the extinction of all the population (respectively the vanishing of the invested capital or of the concentration of a chemical substance, etc), the microscopic granularity insures the emergence of macroscopic localized sub-populations with collective adaptive properties which allow their survival and development.

This method can also be used for computational tasks when agents are facing similarly restricted conditions. We formalize the communication and computation assumptions required for successful coordination and prove that the method we propose leads to convergence even when using a dynamically changing interaction network.

Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favor them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing---no deliberate cheating nor loafing---by scientists, only that publication is a principle factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modeling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioral sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more \"progeny\", such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates.

  {"id":"sokolowskiEGFRD2017","abstract":"Biochemical reactions typically occur at low copy numbers, but at once in crowded and diverse environments. Space and stochasticity therefore play an essential role in biochemical networks. Spatial-stochastic simulations have become a prominent tool for understanding how stochasticity at the microscopic level influences the macroscopic behavior of such systems. However, while particle-based models guarantee the level of detail necessary to accurately describe the microscopic dynamics at very low copy numbers, the algorithms used to simulate them oftentimes imply trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy. eGFRD (enhanced Green's Function Reaction Dynamics) is an exact algorithm that evades such trade-offs by partitioning the N-particle system into M<N analytically tractable one- and two-particle systems; the analytical solutions (Green's functions) then are used to implement an event-driven particle-based scheme that allows particles to make large jumps in time and space while retaining access to their state variables at any moment. Here we present \"eGFRD2\", a new eGFRD version that implements the principle of eGFRD in all dimensions, enabling efficient simulation of biochemical reaction-diffusion processes in the 3D cytoplasm, on 2D planes representing membranes, and on 1D elongated cylinders representative of, e.g., cytoskeletal tracks or DNA; in 1D, it also incorporates convective motion used to model active transport. We find that, for low particle densities, eGFRD2 is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than optimized Brownian Dynamics. We exemplify the capabilities of eGFRD2 by simulating an idealized model of Pom1 gradient formation, which involves 3D diffusion, active transport on microtubules, and autophosphorylation on the membrane, confirming recent results on this system and demonstrating that it can efficiently operate under genuinely stochastic conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Sokolowski","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Paijmans","given":"Joris"},{"family":"Bossen","given":"Laurens"},{"family":"Wehrens","given":"Martijn"},{"family":"Miedema","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Becker","given":"Nils B."},{"family":"Kaizu","given":"Kazunari"},{"family":"Takahashi","given":"Koichi"},{"family":"Dogterom","given":"Marlieen"},{"family":"Wolde","given":"Pieter Rein","dropping-particle":"ten"}],"citation-key":"sokolowskiEGFRD2017","container-title":"arXiv:1708.09364 [cond-mat, physics:physics, q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,30]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"eGFRD in all dimensions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09364"},
  {"id":"sokolowskiSpatialStochastic2017","abstract":"Biochemical networks play a crucial role in biological systems, implementing a broad range of vital functions. They normally operate at low copy numbers and in spatial settings, but this is often ignored and well-stirred conditions are assumed. Yet, it is increasingly becoming clear that even microscopic spatial inhomogeneities oftentimes can induce significant differences on the macroscopic level. Since experimental observation of single-molecule behavior is extremely challenging, theoretical modeling of biochemical reactions on the single-particle level is an important tool for understanding spatial effects in biochemical systems. While purely analytical models quickly become intractable here, spatial-stochastic simulations can capture a wide range of biochemical processes with the necessary levels of detail. Here we discuss different techniques for spatial-stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems, and explain important precautions required to make them biochemically accurate and efficient. We illustrate non-negligible accuracy issues arising even in the most simple approaches to biochemical simulation, and present methods to deal with them. We first explain how Brownian Dynamics, a widely used particle-based diffusion simulation technique with fixed propagation time, can be adapted to incorporate chemical reactions, and portray a range of schemes that elaborate on this idea. We then introduce event-driven spatial-stochastic simulation methods, in which system updates are performed asynchronously with situation-dependent, varying time steps; here we particularly focus on eGFRD, a computationally efficient particle-based algorithm that makes use of analytical functions to accurately sample interparticle reactions and diffusive motion with large jumps in time and space.

  {"id":"solomonBehaviorly1999","abstract":"The price fluctuations of the stocks in the financial markets are the result of the individual operations by many individual investors. However for many decades the financial theory did not use directly this “microscopic representation” of the markets. The main difficulties preventing this approach were solved recently with the advent of modern computer technology: – massive detailed data on the individual market operations became available; – “microscopic simulations” of the stock markets in terms of their individual participating agents allow very realistic treatment of the problem. By taking advantage of the modern computer processing and simulation techniques, we are now able to confront real market data with the results of simulating “microscopic” realistic models of the markets. These models have the potential to include and study the effects on the market of any desired feature in the investors behavior: departures from rationality, herding effects, heterogeneous investor-specific trading strategies. We propose to use the comparison of computer simulations of microscopic models with the actual market data in order to validate and enhance the knowledge on the financial behavior of individuals. Moreover we hope to explain, understand (and may be predict and control) macroscopic market dynamical features (e.g., cycles of booms and crashes, investors wealth distribution, market returns probability distribution etc.) based on realistic models using this knowledge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Solomon","given":"Sorin"}],"citation-key":"solomonBehaviorly1999","container-title":"Computer Physics Communications","container-title-short":"Computer Physics Communications","DOI":"10.1016/S0010-4655(99)00304-5","ISSN":"0010-4655","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",9]]},"page":"161-167","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Behaviorly realistic simulations of stock market traders with a soul","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465599003045","volume":"121–122"},

Only recently has it been realized that discrete scale invariance and its associated complex exponents may appear ``spontaneously'' in euclidean systems, i.e. without the need for a pre-existing hierarchy. Examples are diffusion-limited-aggregation clusters, rupture in heterogeneous systems, earthquakes, animals (a generalization of percolation) among many other systems. We review the known mechanisms for the spontaneous generation of discrete scale invariance and provide an extensive list of situations where complex exponents have been found. This is done in order to provide a basis for a better fundamental understanding of discrete scale invariance. The main motivation to study discrete scale invariance and its signatures is that it provides new insights in the underlying mechanisms of scale invariance.

  {"id":"sornetteEndogeneous2002","abstract":"Systems with long-range persistence and memory are shown to exhibit different precursory as well as recovery patterns in response to shocks of exogeneous versus endogeneous origins. By endogeneous, we envision either fluctuations resulting from an underlying chaotic dynamics or from a stochastic forcing origin which may be external or be an effective coarse-grained description of the microscopic fluctuations. In this scenario, endogeneous shocks result from a kind of constructive interference of accumulated fluctuations whose impacts survive longer than the large shocks themselves. As a consequence, the recovery after an endogeneous shock is in general slower at early times and can be at long times either slower or faster than after an exogeneous perturbation. This offers the tantalizing possibility of distinguishing between an endogeneous versus exogeneous cause of a given shock, even when there is no ``smoking gun.'' This could help in investigating the exogeneous versus self-organized origins in problems such as the causes of major biological extinctions, of change of weather regimes and of the climate, in tracing the source of social upheaval and wars, and so on. Sornette, Malevergne and Muzy have already shown how this concept can be applied concretely to differentiate the effects on financial markets of the Sept. 11, 2001 attack or of the coup against Gorbachev on Aug., 19, 1991 (exogeneous) from financial crashes such as Oct. 1987 (endogeneous).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sornette","given":"D."},{"family":"Helmstetter","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"sornetteEndogeneous2002","container-title":"arXiv:cond-mat/0206047","DOI":"10.1016/S0378-4371(02)01371-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",6,4]]},"note":"Physica A 318 (3-4), 577-591 (2003)","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Endogeneous Versus Exogeneous Shocks in Systems with Memory","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0206047"},

If the risk manifests itself at a known, constant hazard rate, a risk-neutral recipient should discount the reward according to an exponential time-preference function. Experimental subjects, however, exhibit short-term time preferences that differ from the exponential in a manner consistent with a hazard rate that falls with increasing delay. It is shown here that this phenomenon can be explained by uncertainty in the underlying hazard. The time-preference function predicted by this analysis can be calculated by means of either (i) a direct superposition method, or (ii) Bayesian updating of the expected hazard rate. The observed hyperbolic time-preference function is consistent with an exponential prior distribution for the underlying hazard rate.

  {"id":"spillHybrid2015","abstract":"Reaction-diffusion models are used to describe systems in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, ecology and biology. The fundamental quantities in such models are individual entities such as atoms and molecules, bacteria, cells or animals, which move and/or react in a stochastic manner. If the number of entities is large, accounting for each individual is inefficient, and often partial differential equation (PDE) models are used in which the stochastic behaviour of individuals is replaced by a description of the averaged, or mean behaviour of the system. In some situations the number of individuals is large in certain regions and small in others. In such cases, a stochastic model may be inefficient in one region, and a PDE model inaccurate in another. To overcome this problem, we develop a scheme which couples a stochastic reaction-diffusion system in one part of the domain with its mean field analogue, i.e. a discretised PDE model, in the other part of the domain. The interface in between the two domains occupies exactly one lattice site and is chosen such that the mean field description is still accurate there. This way errors due to the flux between the domains are small. Our scheme can account for multiple dynamic interfaces separating multiple stochastic and deterministic domains, and the coupling between the domains conserves the total number of particles. The method preserves stochastic features such as extinction not observable in the mean field description, and is significantly faster to simulate on a computer than the pure stochastic model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Spill","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Guerrero","given":"Pilar"},{"family":"Alarcon","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Maini","given":"Philip K."},{"family":"Byrne","given":"Helen"}],"citation-key":"spillHybrid2015","container-title":"Journal of Computational Physics","DOI":"10.1016/j.jcp.2015.07.002","ISSN":"00219991","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",10]]},"page":"429-445","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Hybrid approaches for multiple-species stochastic reaction-diffusion models","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07992","volume":"299"},

The Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma in particular has become a standard model for studying cooperation and cheating, with cooperation often emerging as a robust outcome in evolving populations. Here we extend evolutionary game theory by allowing players’ payoffs as well as their strategies to evolve in response to selection on heritable mutations. In nature, many organisms engage in mutually beneficial interactions and individuals may seek to change the ratio of risk to reward for cooperation by altering the resources they commit to cooperative interactions. To study this, we construct a general framework for the coevolution of strategies and payoffs in arbitrary iterated games. We show that, when there is a tradeoff between the benefits and costs of cooperation, coevolution often leads to a dramatic loss of cooperation in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. The collapse of cooperation is so extreme that the average payoff in a population can decline even as the potential reward for mutual cooperation increases. Depending upon the form of tradeoffs, evolution may even move away from the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game altogether.

  {"id":"stewartExtortion2012","abstract":"Self-serving, rational agents sometimes cooperate to their mutual benefit. However, when and why cooperation emerges is surprisingly hard to pin down. To address this question, scientists from diverse disciplines have used the Prisoner’s Dilemma, a simple two-player game, as a model problem. In PNAS, Press and Dyson (1) dramatically expand our understanding of this classic game by uncovering strategies that provide a unilateral advantage to sentient players pitted against unwitting opponents. By exposing these results, Press and Dyson have fundamentally changed the viewpoint on the Prisoner’s Dilemma, opening a range of new possibilities for the study of cooperation.\n\nFor nearly a century now game theory has influenced the way we think about the world. It has entered into the study of almost every type of human interaction, including economics, political science, war games, and evolutionary biology. This is because, at its core, game theory seeks to explain how rational players should behave to best serve their own interests. Game theory emerged as a field of active research with the work of John von Neumann on mathematical economics (2, 3). John Nash built on this foundation when he introduced the concept of a Nash Equilibrium (4), which occurs when no player can gain by unilaterally changing strategy. The impact of Nash’s work, which began with economics, was soon felt in evolutionary biology, when John Maynard Smith and George Price introduced a variant form of equilibrium, the evolutionary stable strategy (5), which, when dominant in an evolving population, cannot be invaded and replaced by any other strategy.\n\nThe Prisoner’s Dilemma itself is well established as a way to study the emergence of cooperative behavior. Each player is simultaneously offered two options: to cooperate or defect.

The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors.A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with the mathematical theory.Richly illustrated, and with many exercises and worked examples, this book is ideal for an introductory course at the junior/senior or first-year graduate level. It is also ideal for the scientist who has not had formal instruction in nonlinear dynamics, but who now desires to begin informal study. The prerequisites are multivariable calculus and introductory physics.","author":[{"family":"Strogatz","given":"Steven Henry"}],"citation-key":"strogatzNonlinear1994","ISBN":"0-7382-0453-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"520","publisher":"Westview Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering","title-short":"Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos","type":"book"},

Apart from cooperators and defectors a third strategical type is considered: the risk averse loners who are unwilling to participate in the social enterprise and rather rely on small but fixed earnings. This results in a rock-scissors-paper type of cyclic dominance of the three strategies. In the prisoner’s dilemma, the effects of voluntary participation crucially depend on the underlying population structure. While leading to homogeneous states of all loners in well-mixed populations, we demonstrate that cyclic dominance produces self-organizing patterns on square lattices but leads to different types of oscillatory behavior on random regular graphs: the temptation to defect determines whether damped, periodic, or increasing oscillations occur.

Random sequential dynamics on a square lattice is governed by very symmetrical transition rules for neighborhood invasion of sensitive strains by killers, killers by resistants, and resistants by by sensitives. The community of the nine possible toxicity/resistance types undergoes a critical phase transition as the uniform transmutation rates between the types decreases below a critical value $P_c$ above which all the nine types of strain coexist with equal frequencies. Passing the critical mutation rate from above, the system collapses into one of the three topologically identical states, each consisting of three strain types. Of the three final states each accrues with equal probability and all three maintain themselves in a self-organizing polydomain structure via cyclic invasions.

In spatial settings with players arranged on a regular lattice this results in interesting dynamical properties and intriguing spatio-temporal patterns. In particular, variations of the value of the public good leads to transitions between one-, two- and three-strategy states which are either in the class of directed percolation or show interesting analogies to Ising-type models.

  {"id":"takahasiEvolution1998","abstract":"Evolution of transmission bias in cultural inheritance is investigated using simple models of cultural selection. Conventional models of cultural transmission describe cultural changes by incorporating transmission bias and non-vertical pathways into the ordinary population genetic framework. The methodology has been successful in understanding cultural changes in terms of natural selection, but it is difficult to see from the theoretical framework how biased transmission in favor of maladaptive traits might have evolved. To show that ordinary cultural processes lead at times to the evolution of a preference that favors a deleterious cultural variant, this study presents an alternative model of cultural transmission, where cultural elements are transmitted in a manner more like infections in epidemiological transmission. An ordinary equilibrium analysis indicates that, under certain conditions, runaway dynamics emerges and the coevolution of a maladaptive cultural variant and an associated preference in favor of the maladaptive variant is observed. If the preference of an individual does not change during its ontogeny (e.g., if it is transmitted genetically), however, than cultural selection alone does not produce such runaway dynamics, and only those preferences that favor adaptive variants should eventually evolve. Since cultural processes may at times result in a reduction in the fitness of individuals, simplistic adaptive interpretations of culture are unconvincing without detailed specification of the cultural processes involved. Moreover, cultural runaway of this kind may help to explain the existence of traits that are apparently maladaptive at the individual level but may be advantageous for the group. Inferences are also made regarding the observed differences between human and non-human social information transfer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Takahasi","given":"Kiyosi"}],"citation-key":"takahasiEvolution1998","container-title":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","DOI":"10.1006/jtbi.1997.0541","ISSN":"0022-5193","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",1,21]]},"page":"147-159","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Evolution of Transmission Bias in Cultural Inheritance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519397905415","volume":"190"},

Simulated FSPPs and FRSPPs consistently exhibit bias in this fractal exponent, however, rendering the study and analysis of these processes non-trivial. In this paper, we examine the synthesis and estimation of FRSPPs by carrying out a systematic series of simulations for several different types of FRSPP over a range of design values for $\\alpha$. The discrepancy between the desired and achieved values of $\\alpha$ is shown to arise from finite data size and from the character of the point-process generation mechanism. In the context of point-process simulation, reduction of this discrepancy requires generating data sets with either a large number of points, or with low jitter in the generation of the points.

This law is applicable not only to the comparison of physical stimulus intensities but also to qualitative comparative judgments, such as those of excellence of specimens in an educational scale. It should be possible also to verify it on comparative judgments which involve simultaneous and successive contrast. The law is stated as follows:[Equation omitted]in which S1 and S2 are the psychological scale values of the two compared stimuli; x12 is the sigma value corresponding to the proportion of judgments p1 > p2. ς1 is the discriminal dispersion of stimulus R1 and ς2 is the dispersion of stimulus R2. r is the correlation between the discriminal deviations of R1 and R2 in the same judgment. This law is basic for work on Weber's and Fechner's laws, applies to the judgments of a single observer who compares a series of stimuli by the method of paired comparisons when no 'equal' judgments are allowed, and is a rational equation for the method of constant stimuli. The law is then applied to five cases each of which involves different assumptions and different degrees of simplification of the law for practical use. The weighting of the observation equations is discussed because the observation equations obtained with the five cases are not of the same reliability and hence should not be equally weighted.

We reach several significant conclusions as follows: (1) a complex ecosystem can emerge when mutants with respect to species-specific interaction are introduced; (2) such an ecosystem possesses strong resistance to invasion; (3) a typical fixation process of mutants is realized through the rapid growth of a group of mutualistic mutants with higher fitness than majority species; (4) a hierarchical taxonomic structure (like family–genus–species) emerges; and (5) the relative abundance of species exhibits a typical pattern widely observed in nature. Several implications of these results are discussed in connection with the relationship of the present model to the generalized Lotka–Volterra equation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Tokita","given":"Kei"},{"family":"Yasutomi","given":"Ayumu"}],"citation-key":"tokitaEmergence2003","container-title":"Theoretical Population Biology","DOI":"10.1016/S0040-5809(02)00038-2","ISSN":"0040-5809","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",3]]},"page":"131-146","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Emergence of a complex and stable network in a model ecosystem with extinction and mutation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580902000382","volume":"63"},

  {"id":"traulsenCoevolutionary2006","abstract":"Coevolving and competing species or game-theoretic strategies exhibit rich and complex dynamics for which a general theoretical framework based on finite populations is still lacking. Recently, an explicit mean-field description in the form of a Fokker-Planck equation was derived for frequency-dependent selection with two strategies in finite populations based on microscopic processes [ A. Traulsen, J. C. Claussen and C. Hauert Phys. Rev. Lett. 95 238701 (2005)]. Here we generalize this approach in a twofold way: First, we extend the framework to an arbitrary number of strategies and second, we allow for mutations in the evolutionary process. The deterministic limit of infinite population size of the frequency-dependent Moran process yields the adjusted replicator-mutator equation, which describes the combined effect of selection and mutation. For finite populations, we provide an extension taking random drift into account. In the limit of neutral selection, i.e., whenever the process is determined by random drift and mutations, the stationary strategy distribution is derived. This distribution forms the background for the coevolutionary process. In particular, a critical mutation rate uc is obtained separating two scenarios: above uc the population predominantly consists of a mixture of strategies whereas below uc the population tends to be in homogeneous states. For one of the fundamental problems in evolutionary biology, the evolution of cooperation under Darwinian selection, we demonstrate that the analytical framework provides excellent approximations to individual based simulations even for rather small population sizes. This approach complements simulation results and provides a deeper, systematic understanding of coevolutionary dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Traulsen","given":"Arne"},{"family":"Claussen","given":"Jens Christian"},{"family":"Hauert","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"traulsenCoevolutionary2006","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

  {"id":"traulsenExploration2009","abstract":"Evolutionary game theory describes systems where individual success is based on the interaction with others. We consider a system in which players unconditionally imitate more successful strategies but sometimes also explore the available strategies at random. Most research has focused on how strategies spread via genetic reproduction or cultural imitation, but random exploration of the available set of strategies has received less attention so far. In genetic settings, the latter corresponds to mutations in the DNA, whereas in cultural evolution, it describes individuals experimenting with new behaviors. Genetic mutations typically occur with very small probabilities, but random exploration of available strategies in behavioral experiments is common. We term this phenomenon “exploration dynamics” to contrast it with the traditional focus on imitation. As an illustrative example of the emerging evolutionary dynamics, we consider a public goods game with cooperators and defectors and add punishers and the option to abstain from the enterprise in further scenarios. For small mutation rates, cooperation (and punishment) is possible only if interactions are voluntary, whereas moderate mutation rates can lead to high levels of cooperation even in compulsory public goods games. This phenomenon is investigated through numerical simulations and analytical approximations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Traulsen","given":"Arne"},{"family":"Hauert","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Hannelore De"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Martin A."},{"family":"Sigmund","given":"Karl"}],"citation-key":"traulsenExploration2009","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0808450106","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1,20]]},"language":"en","page":"709-712","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Exploration dynamics in evolutionary games","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/106/3/709","volume":"106"},

It is shown that the very tail of $p_{_N}(x)$ has a Gaussian form if and only if all the random terms are distributed according to the Gauss Law. In all other cases the tail for $p_{_N}(x)$ differs from the Gaussian. If the variances of random terms diverge the non-Gaussian tail is related to a Levy distribution for $p_{_N}(x)$. However, the tail is not Gaussian even if the variances are finite. In the latter case $p_{_N}(x)$ has two different asymptotics. At small and moderate values of $x$ the distribution is Gaussian. At large $x$ the non-Gaussian tail arises. The crossover between the two asymptotics occurs at $x$ proportional to $N$. For this reason the non-Gaussian tail exists at finite $N$ only. In the limit $N$ tends to infinity the origin of the tail is shifted to infinity, i. e., the tail vanishes. Depending on the particular type of the distribution of the random terms the non-Gaussian tail may decay either slower than the Gaussian, or faster than it. A number of particular examples is discussed in detail.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Tribelsky","given":"Michael I"}],"citation-key":"tribelskyTails2001","container-title":"arXiv:math/0106037","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",6,6]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Tails of probability density for sums of random independent variables","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0106037"},

For the initial months in which the Ebola virus spreads, we find that the arrival times of the disease into the counties predicted by our model are in good agreement with World Health Organization data. We also find that reducing mobility delays the arrival of Ebola virus in each county by only a few weeks, and as a consequence, is insufficient to contain the epidemic. Finally we study the effect of a strategy focused on increasing safe burials and hospitalization under two scenarios: (i) one implemented in mid-July 2014 and (ii) one in mid-August, which was the actual time that strong interventions began in Liberia. We find that if scenario (i) had been pursued the lifetime of the epidemic would have been reduced by three months and the total number of infected individuals reduced by 80\\%, when compared to scenario (ii).

  {"id":"vespignaniHow1998","abstract":"We present a unified dynamical mean-field theory, based on the single site approximation to the master-equation, for stochastic self-organized critical models. In particular, we analyze in detail the properties of sandpile and forest-fire (FF) models. In analogy with other nonequilibrium critical phenomena, we identify an order parameter with the density of “active” sites, and control parameters with the driving rates. Depending on the values of the control parameters, the system is shown to reach a subcritical (absorbing) or supercritical (active) stationary state. Criticality is analyzed in terms of the singularities of the zero-field susceptibility. In the limit of vanishing control parameters, the stationary state displays scaling characteristics of self-organized criticality (SOC). We show that this limit corresponds to the breakdown of space-time locality in the dynamical rules of the models. We define a complete set of critical exponents, describing the scaling of order parameter, response functions, susceptibility and correlation length in the subcritical and supercritical states. In the subcritical state, the response of the system to small perturbations takes place in avalanches. We analyze their scaling behavior in relation with branching processes. In sandpile models, because of conservation laws, a critical exponents subset displays mean-field values (ν=1/2 and γ=1) in any dimensions. We treat bulk and boundary dissipation and introduce a critical exponent relating dissipation and finite size effects. We present numerical simulations that confirm our results. In the case of the forest-fire model, our approach can distinguish between different regimes (SOC-FF and deterministic FF) studied in the literature, and determine the full spectrum of critical exponents.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Vespignani","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Zapperi","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"vespignaniHow1998","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

We obtain an attractive fixed point in the phase space of the parameters that clarifies the self-organized critical nature of these systems. The universality class of several models is identified by studying the properties of the basin of attraction of this fixed point. We compute analytically the avalanche exponent τ and the dynamical exponent z for sandpile models in d=2. The values obtained are in very good agreement with computer simulations. The renormalization scheme can also be applied to study nonconservative sandpile models.

A series of path models based on a meta-analytically derived correlation matrix showed that (a) intelligence is the single most powerful predictor of academic performance; (b) the effects of intelligence on academic performance are not mediated by personality traits; (c) intelligence, Conscientiousness (as marker of effort), and Typical Intellectual Engagement (as marker of intellectual curiosity) are direct, correlated predictors of academic performance; and (d) the additive predictive effect of the personality traits of intellectual curiosity and effort rival that the influence of intelligence.

  {"id":"vrielingTooth2010","abstract":"Tooth resorption affecting several teeth is a painful disease with a prevalence of up to 75% in household cats and is often accompanied by periodontitis. Tooth resorption is caused by an increased number and activity of tooth-resorbing odontoclasts, cells that share functional characteristics with bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Both vitamin D and inflammatory cytokines stimulate the formation and activity of osteoclasts. Most mammals are able to synthesize vitamin D in their skin, but cats are not able to do so and thus depend on their dietary intake for their vitamin D requirements. Both a deficiency and an excess of dietary vitamin D have been hypothesized to be involved in tooth resorption. The overall focus of this thesis was to gain insight into the possible role of vitamin D and inflammation in tooth resorption in cats. Binding of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D) to the nuclear vitamin D receptor (nVDR) of fibroblasts and odontoclasts near active resorptive lesions was found to induce the transcription of target genes of the vitamin D pathway, i.e. 1?-hydroxylase, 24-hydroxylase, receptor-activator of NF?B ligand (RANKL), and VDR itself. Inflammatory cells were often found in the resorption lacunae, and the expression of inflammatory cytokine was increased in surrounding tissues. The stimulatory effect of 1,25(OH)2D on osteoclast formation was demonstrated in vitro by the formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase multinucleated cells from peripheral blood originating from cats with tooth resorption. Periodontal pathogenic bacteria may be part of the aetiopathogenesis of tooth resorption in cats through the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in odontoclast activity. Two periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas spp. and Tanerella forsythia, were found in dental plaque samples from cats. Two identical isolates of Tanerella forsythia of feline origin were found in a cat and its owner, which supported the idea that cats are a potential source of a periodontal zoonotic agent. Findings support the conclusion that odontoclast activity in cats with tooth resorption is stimulated by locally produced 1,25(OH)2D, facilitated through the nVDR expressing fibroblasts and odontoclasts and enhanced by inflammatory products. Local up-regulation of target genes of the vitamin D pathway further supports the observed increase in the activity of local vitamin D metabolites. We propose that not dietary vitamin D excess but inflammation-induced stimulation of the vitamin D pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of tooth resorption in cats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Vrieling","given":"H.

This is important, because environments can change much faster than new mutations arise.

Here, we study the effect of stochasticity caused by the finiteness of the population size on evolutionary branching. By analyzing the dynamics of trait variance, we obtain the condition for evolutionary branching as the one under which trait variance explodes. Genetic drift reduces the trait variance and causes stochastic fluctuation. In a very small population, evolutionary branching does not occur. In larger populations, evolutionary branching may occur, but it occurs in two different manners: in deterministic branching, branching occurs quickly when the population reaches the singular point, while in stochastic branching, the population stays at singularity for a period before branching out. The conditions for these cases and the mean branching-out times are calculated in terms of population size, mutational effects, and selection intensity and are confirmed by direct computer simulations of the individual-based model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Wakano","given":"Joe Yuichiro"},{"family":"Iwasa","given":"Yoh"}],"citation-key":"wakanoEvolutionary2013","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.112.144980","ISSN":"0016-6731, 1943-2631","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"229-241","source":"www.genetics.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca","title":"Evolutionary Branching in a Finite Population: Deterministic Branching vs. Stochastic Branching","title-short":"Evolutionary Branching in a Finite Population","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.genetics.org/content/193/1/229","volume":"193"},

One powerful and useful way to do this is the system size expansion of van Kampen to express a trajectory as a small stochastic perturbation to a deterministic trajectory, using a small parameter related to the volume of the system in question. This is usually pursued only up to first order, called the Linear Noise Approximation. The usual derivation of this proceeds via the master equation of the discrete process and derives a Fokker-Planck equation for the stochastic perturbation, both of which are equations for the evolution of probability distributions. Here we present a derivation using stochastic difference equations for the discrete process and leading, via the chemical Langevin equation of Gillespie, directly to a stochastic differential equation for the stochastic perturbation.

  {"id":"wangIf2012","abstract":"Spatial reciprocity is a well known tour de force of cooperation promotion. A thorough understanding of the effects of different population densities is therefore crucial. Here we study the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas on different interaction graphs with a certain fraction of vacant nodes. We find that sparsity may favor the resolution of social dilemmas, especially if the population density is close to the percolation threshold of the underlying graph. Regardless of the type of the governing social dilemma as well as particularities of the interaction graph, we show that under pairwise imitation the percolation threshold is a universal indicator of how dense the occupancy ought to be for cooperation to be optimally promoted. We also demonstrate that myopic updating, due to the lack of efficient spread of information via imitation, renders the reported mechanism dysfunctional, which in turn further strengthens its foundations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Szolnoki","given":"Attila"},{"family":"Perc","given":"Matjaz"}],"citation-key":"wangIf2012","container-title":"arXiv:1205.2687","DOI":"10.1038/srep00369","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",5,11]]},"note":"Sci.

Learning programming with such a media-focused context has been shown to increase retention and success rate. However, assessing these visual, interactive projects requires time and laborious manual effort, and it is therefore difficult to offer automated or real-time feedback to students as they work. In this paper, we introduce SnapCheck, a dynamic testing framework for Snap that enables instructors to author test cases with Condition-Action templates. The goal of SnapCheck is to allow instructors or researchers to author property-based test cases that can automatically assess students' interactive programs with high accuracy. Our evaluation of SnapCheck on 162 code snapshots from a Pong game assignment in an introductory programming course shows that our automated testing framework achieves at least 98% accuracy over all rubric items, showing potentials to use SnapCheck for auto-grading and providing formative feedback to students.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Wengran"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chenhao"},{"family":"Stahlbauer","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Fraser","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Price","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"wangSnapCheck2021","collection-title":"ITiCSE '21","container-title":"Proceedings of the 26th ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education V. 1","DOI":"10.1145/3430665.3456367","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-8214-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,26]]},"page":"227–233","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"SnapCheck: Automated Testing for Snap!

  {"id":"watkins252016","abstract":"Introduced by the late Per Bak and his colleagues, self-organized criticality (SOC) has been one of the most stimulating concepts to come out of statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory in the last few decades, and has played a significant role in the development of complexity science. SOC, and more generally fractals and power laws, have attacted much comment, ranging from the very positive to the polemical. The other papers in this special issue (Aschwanden et al, 2014; McAteer et al, 2014; Sharma et al, 2015) showcase the considerable body of observations in solar, magnetospheric and fusion plasma inspired by the SOC idea, and expose the fertile role the new paradigm has played in approaches to modeling and understanding multiscale plasma instabilities. This very broad impact, and the necessary process of adapting a scientific hypothesis to the conditions of a given physical system, has meant that SOC as studied in these fields has sometimes differed significantly from the definition originally given by its creators. In Bak's own field of theoretical physics there are significant observational and theoretical open questions, even 25 years on (Pruessner, 2012). One aim of the present review is to address the dichotomy between the great reception SOC has received in some areas, and its shortcomings, as they became manifest in the controversies it triggered. Our article tries to clear up what we think are misunderstandings of SOC in fields more remote from its origins in statistical mechanics, condensed matter and dynamical systems by revisiting Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld's original papers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Watkins","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Pruessner","given":"Gunnar"},{"family":"Chapman","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Crosby","given":"Norma Bock"},{"family":"Jensen","given":"Henrik"}],"citation-key":"watkins252016","container-title":"Space Science Reviews","container-title-short":"Space Sci Rev","DOI":"10.1007/s11214-015-0155-x","ISSN":"0038-6308, 1572-9672","issue":"1-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1]]},"page":"3-44","source":"arXiv.org","title":"25 Years of Self-Organized Criticality: Concepts and Controversies","title-short":"25 Years of Self-Organized Criticality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04991","volume":"198"},

The latter enter the central equation of motion, i.e. the master equation, for the probability distribution over the possible macroconfigurations of society. From the master equation the equations of motion for the expectation values of the macrovariables of society can be derived. These equations are in general nonlinear. Their solutions may include stationary solutions, limit cycles and strange attractors, and with varying trend parameters also phase transitions between different modes of social behaviour can be described.\n\nThe general model construction approach is subsequently applied to characteristic examples from different social sciences, such as sociology, demography, regional science and economics.

  {"id":"whiteInquiry1998","abstract":"Our objective has been to develop an instructional theory and corresponding curricular materials that make scientific inquiry accessible to a wide range of students, including younger and lower achieving students. We hypothesized that this could be achieved by recognizing the importance of metacognition and creating an instructional approach that develops students' metacognitive knowledge and skills through a process of scaffolded inquiry, reflection, and generalization. Toward this end, we collaborated with teachers to create a computer enhanced, middle school science curriculum that engages students in learning about and reflecting on the processes of scientific inquiry as they construct increasingly complex models of force and motion phenomena. The resulting ThinkerTools Inquiry Curriculum centers around a metacognitive model of research, called the Inquiry Cycle, and a metacognitive process, called Reflective Assessment, in which students reflect on their own and each other's inquiry. In this article, we report on instructional trials of the curriculum by teachers in urban classrooms, including a controlled comparison to determine the impact of including or not including the Reflective Assessment Process. Overall, the curriculum proved successful and students' performance improved significantly on both physics and inquiry assessments. The controlled comparison revealed that students' learning was greatly facilitated by Reflective Assessment. Furthermore, adding this metacognitive process to the curriculum was particularly beneficial for low-achieving students: Performance on their research projects and inquiry tests was significantly closer to that of high-achieving students than was the case in the control classes. Thus, this approach has the valuable effect of reducing the educational disadvantage of low achieving students while also being beneficial for high-achieving students. We argue that these findings have strong implications for what such metacognitively focused, inquiry-oriented curricula can accomplish, particularly in urban school settings in which there are many disadvantaged students.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"White","given":"Barbara Y."},{"family":"Frederiksen","given":"John R."}],"citation-key":"whiteInquiry1998","container-title":"Cognition and Instruction","DOI":"10.1207/s1532690xci1601_2","ISSN":"0737-0008","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",3,1]]},"page":"3-118","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Inquiry, Modeling, and Metacognition: Making Science Accessible to All Students","title-short":"Inquiry, Modeling, and Metacognition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s1532690xci1601_2","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"willingerSelfSimilarity1995","abstract":"Traffic modeling of today's communication networks is a prime example of the role statistical inference methods for stochastic processes play in such classical areas of applied probability as queueing theory or performance analysis. In practice, however, statistics and applied probability have failed to interface. As a result, traffic modeling and performance analysis rely heavily on subjective arguments; hence, debates concerning the validity of a proposed model and its predicted performance abound. In this paper, we show how a careful statistical analysis of large sets of actual traffic measurements can reveal new features of network traffic that have gone unnoticed by the literature and, yet, seem to have serious implications for predicted network performance. We use hundreds of millions of high-quality traffic measurements from an Ethernet local area network to demonstrate that Ethernet traffic is statistically self-similar and that this property clearly distinguishes between currently used models for packet traffic and our measured data. We also indicate how such a unique data set (in terms of size and quality) (i) can be used to illustrate a number of different statistical inference methods for self-similar processes, (ii) gives rise to new and challenging problems in statistics, statistical computing and probabilistic modeling and (iii) opens up new areas of mathematical research in queueing theory and performance analysis of future high-speed networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Willinger","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Taqqu","given":"Murad S."},{"family":"Leland","given":"Will E."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Daniel V."}],"citation-key":"willingerSelfSimilarity1995","container-title":"Statistical Science","ISSN":"0883-4237","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",2,1]]},"note":"ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Feb., 1995 / Copyright © 1995 Institute of Mathematical Statistics","page":"67-85","source":"JSTOR","title":"Self-Similarity in High-Speed Packet Traffic: Analysis and Modeling of Ethernet Traffic Measurements","title-short":"Self-Similarity in High-Speed Packet Traffic","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2246232","volume":"10"},

A detailed analysis is given of \"elementary\" cellular automata consisting of a sequence of sites with values 0 or 1 on a line, with each site evolving deterministically in discrete time steps according to definite rules involving the values of its nearest neighbors. With simple initial configurations, the cellular automata either tend to homogeneous states, or generate self-similar patterns with fractal dimensions ≃ 1.59 or ≃ 1.69. With \"random\" initial configurations, the irreversible character of the cellular automaton evolution leads to several self-organization phenomena.

However, unlike the usual phase transitions of physics, this transition takes place over a range of values of the parameter rather than at a specific value. The present paper asks whether the transition can be made sharp, either by taking the limit of an infinitely large rule table, or by changing the parameter in terms of which the space of automata is explored. We find strong evidence that, for the class of automata we consider, the transition does become sharp in the limit of an infinite number of symbols, the size of the neighborhood being held fixed. Our work also suggests an alternative parameter in terms of which it is likely that the transition will become fairly sharp even if one does not increase the number of symbols.

The calcium permeability of TRPV2 channels in T24 cells was investigated using a calcium imaging assay that used cannabidiol (CBD), a relatively selective TRPV2 agonist, and ruthenium red (RuR), a nonselective TRPV channel antagonist. The death of T24 or RT4 cells in the presence of CBD was evaluated using a cellular viability assay. Apoptosis of T24 cells caused by CBD was confirmed using an annexin-V assay and small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of TRPV2.\nResults\nTRPV2 mRNA was abundantly expressed in T24 cells. The expression level in UC cells was correlated with high-grade disease. The administration of CBD increased intracellular calcium concentrations in T24 cells. In addition, the viability of T24 cells progressively decreased with increasing concentrations of CBD, whereas RT4 cells were mostly unaffected. Cell death occurred via apoptosis caused by continuous influx of calcium through TRPV2.\nConclusions\nTRPV2 channels in UC cells are calcium-permeable and the regulation of calcium influx through these channels leads directly to the death of UC cells.

  {"id":"yamamuraEvolution1996","abstract":"In geological history, rapid speciation, called adaptive radiation, has occurred repeatedly. The origins of such newly developing taxa often evolved from the symbiosis of different species. Mutualistic symbioses are generally considered to evolve from parasitic relationships. As well as the previous model of host population with discrete generations, a differential equation model of host population with overlapping generations shows that vertical transmission, defined as the direct transfer of infection from a parent host to its progeny, is an important factor which can stimulate reduction of parasite virulence. Evolution of the vertical transmission rate from both points of view, the parasite and the host, is analyzed. There is a critical level of the rate, below which an evolutionary conflict arises (the parasite would want an increase in the rate while the host would not), and above which both species would correspond to increase the rate. Therefore, once the parasite dominates the evolutionary race so as to overcome this critical level, one-way evolution begins toward a highly mutualistic relationship with a high vertical transmission rate, possibly creating a new organism through symbiosis with perfect vertical transmission. Changes in other parameters may decrease the critical level, initiating one-way evolution. However, changes in traits, probably developed through a long interrelationship in parasitism, do not necessarily induce the evolution of mutualism. Establishment of the ability to make use of metabolic and digestive wastes from the partner certainly facilitates the evolution of mutualism, while improvements in reproductive efficiency of parasites and reduction of negative effects from exploitation in hosts on the contrary disturb mutualism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Yamamura","given":"Norio"}],"citation-key":"yamamuraEvolution1996","container-title":"Researches on Population Ecology","container-title-short":"Res Popul Ecol","DOI":"10.1007/BF02515729","ISSN":"0034-5466, 1437-5613","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"211-218","source":"link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca","title":"Evolution of mutualistic symbiosis: A differential equation model","title-short":"Evolution of mutualistic symbiosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/article/10.1007/BF02515729","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"zwiersTaking1995","abstract":"Abstract The comparison of means derived from samples of noisy data is a standard pan of climatology. When the data are not serially correlated the appropriate statistical tool for this task is usually the conventional Student's t-test. However, frequently data are serially correlated in climatological applications with the result that the t test in its standard form is not applicable. The usual solution to this problem is to scale the t statistic by a factor that depends upon the equivalent sample size ne. It is shown, by means of simulations, that the revised t tea is often conservative (the actual significance level is smaller than the specified significance level) when the equivalent sample size is known. However, in most practical cases the equivalent sample size is not known. Then the test becomes liberal (the actual significance level is greater than the specified significance level). This systematic error becomes small when the true equivalent sample size is large (greater than approximately 30). The difficulties inherent in difference of means tests when there is serial dependence are reexamined. Guidelines for the application of the “usual” t test are provided and two alternative tests are proposed that substantially improve upon the “usual” t test when samples are small.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zwiers","given":"Francis W."},{"family":"Storch","given":"Hans","non-dropping-particle":"von"}],"citation-key":"zwiersTaking1995","container-title":"Journal of Climate","container-title-short":"J.
