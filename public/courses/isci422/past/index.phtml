<h3>An Agent Based Model of the Action Potential</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

The Hodgkin Huxley equations were the first to characterize the action potential.  It was done by describing a sodium, a potassium and a leak current; they do not explicitly describe the discrete ion channels causing these currents.  The number of ion channels can be directly regulated by the neuron, but since the Hodgkin Huxley model does not explicitly deal with the ion channels, it is unable to predict how this would affect the characteristics of the action potential.  We created an agent based model of the action potential which simulated each ion channel individually to try and understand how changing the number of ion channels could affect the characteristics of the action potential.  Here we show that the amplitude of the action potential increases, and the time until the maximum and minimum voltages decreases as the number of sodium and potassium ion channels increase.  Since generating the action potential is the rate limiting step of current conduction in the axon, our data implies that increasing the number of ion channels should increase the speed at which the action potential is propagated down the nerve fibre, and that regulating the number of ion channels is critical in neurons involved in reflex arcs that must be optimized for speed.

<h3>Developing an Innovative Nanopharmaceutical for Cancer Treatment</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

I have developed a numerical computer model to help develop a drug
technology (nanopharmaceutical) that is intended for use in cancer patients.
The formulation that we have developed in our laboratory includes the drug
trastuzumab, which is used to treat breast cancer, and we have found that our
nanopharmaceutical is much more efficacious than trastuzumab alone. In an
effort to explain these effects, we have turned to the lipid raft concept, a
revolutionary new theory on the way that cellular membranes function. My
model encompasses several aspects of the way that our nanopharmaceutical
would be expected to interact with lipid rafts in the cell membrane, and has
provided results that are readily and directly testable in our laboratory. I intend
to experimentally verify these results to strengthen the assertions of the model.

<h3>Relating Calcium Influx Induced Dendritic Expansion to the Increased Conductance in Long-Term Potentiation Maintenance</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Long-term potentiation has been implicated in memory formation and learning in the
hippocampus. While the presynaptic terminal is associated with the induction of LTP, the
postsynaptic terminal is associated with the maintenance of it. This paper examines the
possible role of calcium-induced postsynaptic restructuring in LTP by constructing a
numerical model based on the characterized kinetic properties of the individual
components. The model simulates the proposed pathway from calcium influx to AMPA
receptor insertion and the subsequent increase in membrane conductance. As predicted by
the hypothesis, the magnitude of conductance increase was found to be dependent on the
peak calcium concentration. However, because the increases were only minimal, it was
proposed other postsynaptic mechanisms also contribute to the increased conductance in
addition to AMPA insertion.

<h3>Making Sense of the Unknown: A Model for Increased Cognitive Load for Recognizing Ambiguous Words</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

People can distinguish and categorize a wide range of phonological variations in
speech into distinctive categories of words. However, as the speech sound becomes more
degraded (with noise or with differential attention and speech production), it becomes
harder to hear and takes longer for us to recognize (Andruski, Blumstein, & Burton,
1994, Hoff, 2001, Aydelotte & Bates, 2004, & Blumstein, 2004). This paper will
propose a mathematical model of processes that contribute to the increased processing
time for ambiguous sounds. Using Microsoft Excel and the construction of an artificial
language, the model will use a probabilistic approach to describe sounds. This study will
explore the frequency effect and the contextual (lexical) effects of sounds on word
recognition. The number of steps taken to achieve word recognition is compared to
quality of sound input. Results and predictions made by the model are found to be
comparable to observations of reaction times over acoustic continua constructed with
varying voice onset time. Suggestions of future improvements involving the Bayesian
Probability Theory and Neural Networks are also suggested.

<h3>A Model of Adelie Penguin Colony Establishment</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Adelie penguins are flightless aquatic birds that breed on gravel beaches along the Antarctic coastline. The ecosystem in Antarctica has a delicate balance due to the low number of species. Changing climatic conditions have led to variations in the ice cover, thus breeding sites of Adelie penguins are more dynamic now. New colony establishment is becoming more common as penguins emigrate from crowded colonies to the new breeding sites. It is important to understand colony formation as it will affect overall penguin population dynamics. A model was developed to further understand population patterns of an
establishing colony and the number of immigrant penguins required. In order for a new colony to be self-sustaining, the immigrating penguins must produce enough chicks that survive to maturity to replace the adult penguins who perish. The
various mortality and survival factors of adults and their young were integrated into a model on the Simile computer program. The model was able to predict that 44 was the minimum number of immigrating adult penguins required to establish a self-sustaining colony. However this number was determined to be highly dependent on fluctuations in mortality. As well, a pattern for population growth during a colony establishment period was found which included a ‘lag time’ and a ‘recovery period.’

<h3>Influenza A Reassortment</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Influenza A is an RNA virus, and found in a wide range of strains and subtypes around the world.  The various subtypes of influenza A viruses are identified by which versions of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins they possess.  New subtypes can result from reassortment when two virus subtypes infect a single host. Pandemics of influenza A can be caused if such a subtype is highly pathogenic. Using sequence similarity and knowledge of existing subtypes as a basis for defining the characteristics of various types of HA and NA proteins, a computer model was designed in which there is infection of a population of humans by avian influenza subtypes and thus new subtypes are created through reassortment. Based on the predicted pathogenicity, virulence, and complementary action of the HA and NA proteins in a new subtype, its ability to spread amongst and kill the model population is simulated.  Using this model, two experiments were conducted.  The first involved the infection of the population by many new subtypes, from which insights into how different subtypes  behave under the same conditions were derived.  The second involved the infection of only one avian subtype.  Pathogenicity, virulence and reassortment rates were all varied for the new subtypes resulting from reassortment.  The results showed pathogenicity to be the dominant factor in determining the number of deaths due to a new subtype.  Such a model can be used to predict the likelihood that new subtypes will cause a deadly pandemic, and thus could prove useful in directing efforts to create vaccines and the distribution of anti-viral drugs to high risk individuals.
