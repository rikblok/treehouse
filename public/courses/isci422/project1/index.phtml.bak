<? tochead(array('name'=>'Objective')); ?>


<p>The objective of this project is to examine published examples of scientific work which utilize models so as to develop a definition of the term &quot;model&quot; as used in science.</p>  

<p>Working in groups of four (assigned), search the scientific literature to find two papers that use a model as a central part of the work. Each paper must have been published recently<?=footref("1");?> in a major journal<?=footref("2");?>. <b>Each group will be assigned topic areas within which to work.  Find one article in each area.</b>  Each group must return to the seminar room to have their choice of papers approved before the end of class.</p>

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Report')); ?>

<p>Working in groups write a short report (see the <a href="#Template">template</a> for page limits) that
<ul><li>For each article:
	<ul><li>Briefly explains what phenomenon is being studied;
		<li>Justifies why the researchers chose this model and/or type of model; and
	</ul>
	<li>Discusses themes common to both papers, especially their use of models.
	<li>Concludes with a brief (25 words or less) definition of &quot;scientific model&quot;.
</ul>

<p>You should not try to explain the model, just rationalize its use.  Append a hard copy of the source papers to the report.</p>

<p>Included in the report must be an assessment of each group member's contribution to the entire project effort.  The distribution of credit must be agreed upon by the group and sum to 60.</p>

<p>Final project reports must be submitted to us for grading at <b><?=prettydue('Project 1: Report')?></b>.</p>

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Template', 'level'=>3, 'notoc'=>true)); ?>

<p>A Microsoft Word template is available from <?=url(array('link'=>'http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~rikblok/isci422/templates/project1-report.doc'));?>.  Wherever possible the style in the template should be followed.  If you are unable to view the template let us know and we will provide it in another format.  The template also includes a credit distribution form for you to complete and a grading rubric of the criteria that will be used to evaluate your work.

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Model Definition')); ?>

<p>Prepare to write on the classroom chalkboard, in 25 words or less, your definition of a &quot;scientific model&quot;.  Each member of your group should be able to defend or discuss the definition.</p>

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Grading and Deadlines')); ?>

<p>Project 1 is worth <?=prettyweight('Project 1')?>% of the course total.</p>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" align="center" border="1">
	<?=trh(array()); ?><th align="left">Component</th>	<th align="right">Mark</th>	<th>Deadline</th></tr>
	<?=trbgalt(array()); ?><td>Report</td>	<td align="right"><?=prettyweight('Project 1: Report')?></td>	<td align="center"><?=prettydue('Project 1: Report')?></td></tr>
	<?=trbgalt(array()); ?><td>Definition</td>	<td align="right"><?=prettyweight('Project 1: Definition')?></td>	<td align="center"><?=prettydue('Project 1: Definition')?></td></tr>
	<?=trh(array()); ?><th align="left">Total</th>	<th align="right"><?=prettyweight('Project 1')?></th>	<td></td></tr>
</tr></table>      
Each group member's individual mark will be scaled in accordance with the group distribution form to give individual marks.  Equal credit will be assumed for reports missing signed distribution forms.

<?=footnote("1");?> This depends on the field but in most of the sciences today 10 years is recent.

<?=footnote("2");?> This is very difficult to define from outside a field.  Usually major journals are published by big publishing houses (Kluwer, Elsevier, Pergamon, etc., in the sciences) or by national professional societies or associations in major countries.  We want you to think about this but know that the only thing that really counts is experience in a field.
