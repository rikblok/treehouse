A [NetLogo] {{< cite "wilenskyNetLogo1999" >}} model by Rik Blok.

This simulation is inspired by the Goblin-town chase scene in the film [The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903624/).

<blockquote>
Still goblins go faster than dwarves, and these goblins knew the way better (they had made the paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what they could the dwarves heard the cries and howls getting closer and closer. Soon they could hear even the flap of the goblin feet, many many feet which seemed only just round the last corner. The blink of red torches could be seen behind them in the tunnel they were following; and they were getting deadly tired.

 The [NetLogo] model above simulates a set of platforms and bridges, shown from above. Dwarves (brown) are trying to get from the top-left corner, past the goblins (green), to the escape in the bottom-right corner. The goblins are trying to capture the dwarves before they escape. To see how it works, press setup and, after waiting a few seconds for the scene to be prepared, press go.

You'll see that the dwarves and goblins are both pretty silly â€“ they just stumble around randomly. If a dwarf should happen to find the escape, it's just dumb luck.

Can you do better? You can edit the code in this simulation to try help the dwarves (or goblins). Click **NetLogo Code** at the bottom of the simulation and take a look at these procedures:

```lisp
to turn-dwarf
  ;;;;;; YOUR CODE GOES HERE!
  wiggle 30

end

;---------------------------------------------------------

to turn-goblin
  ;;;;;; YOUR CODE GOES HERE!
  wiggle 90

end
```

<!--
EXAMPLE for tabs
;---------------------------------------------------------

to turn-dwarf
  ;;;;;; YOUR CODE GOES HERE!
  wiggle 30

  ; TODO: delete this
  face-towards-escape
  face-away-from-goblin-sounds
end

;---------------------------------------------------------

to turn-goblin
  ;;;;;; YOUR CODE GOES HERE!
  ;face-random-direction
  wiggle 90

  ; TODO: delete this
  face-towards-dwarf-sounds
end

;---------------------------------------------------------

-->

The command `wiggle` is a [procedure](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/tutorial3.html) I wrote. But it's not very useful -- it just makes the individual randomly turn left or right a bit. Have a look at the `face-â€¦` procedures in the **NetLogo Code** above. Maybe one of those would be better? Go ahead and replace the command `wiggle` in the `turn-dwarf` or `turn-goblin` procedure, then click **Recompile Code** to try it out. Did your changes work the way you expected? (If not, see if you can figure out why not and try again ðŸ™‚)
