I'm interested in the patterns that can emerge when many (often simple) elements interact.  It is often required to build models of these kinds of systems to study their behaviour.  The goal in constructing such models is not to get them "right" (after all, all models are wrong) but rather to capture the important features and discard the unimportant ones.  That's what makes a model useful.

Here you can find some models and, in some cases, emergent phenomena.
