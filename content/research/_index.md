I'm a theoretical statistical physicist by training and a complexologist by nature. The common thread throughout my research is the search for common features of complex, irreducible systems.

Traditionally, science approaches a problem by breaking it into parts and solving each part separately. In some cases, even when the individual pieces are well understood, the interactions between them will lead to surprising outcomes. Many important and diverse systems exhibit this irreducibility: earthquakes, ecosystems, stock markets, weather, computer networks, the immune system, the brain, forest fires, et cetera. Traditional scientific methods are ill-equipped to cope with these complex systems so my approach is to use novel tools such as nonequilibrium statistical physics theory and computer simulations to further our understanding.
