## Presentation for Doebeli lab meeting

<!-- 
{{< cite "blokCan2001" >}}

Idea: Can I specify bibFile here or below to prevent blackmoreMeme2000 from being filled in here?
Can happen when I edit blok00b.md, at least when running hugo server locally.

### Abstract

Assuming culture is transmitted horizontally (via imitation) a model was constructed to determine the conditions under which culture can dominate genetic evolution (“get off the leash” according to Blackmore {{< cite "-blackmoreMeme2000" >}}). Two requirements were found: (1) culture must compete with genes (required only for the effect to be empirically testable); and (2) Interactions between individuals must be confined to small groups or neighbourhoods. The model was tested via analysis and simulation.

In this talk I will present the model, analysis, and simulation results. Feedback is appreciated.
