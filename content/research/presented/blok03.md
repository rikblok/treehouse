### Abstract	

A brief introduction to Lévy flight and fractional Brownian motion from the experimentalist's perspective. Simple tools to analyze these timeseries, the Zipf plot and dispersional analysis, are presented. As a demonstration, these tools are applied to financial and meteorological data to determine the Lévy and Hurst exponents.
