$remarks="
This function is available through the API.  It can be called within the model-supplied routine " . ref("onSimCreate") . " to partition the 2-dimensional world into non-overlapping rectangular <i>blocks</i> of <tt>xRange</tt> by <tt>yRange</tt>, where all sites within a block are linked to each other.  The blocks are tiled starting at the top, left corner of the grid (0,0).  Any partial blocks extending past the boundaries are left incomplete.  

<p><tt>nbrhdBlocks()</tt> provides a convenient way to run multiple, isolated simulations in parallel or it can be used to generate clusters for use with another <tt>nbrhd*()</tt> function (see the example below).
