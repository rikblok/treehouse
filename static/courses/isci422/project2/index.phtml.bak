<? tochead(array('name'=>'Objective')); ?>

<p>In this project you will build and operate a model of your own choosing.  This gives you an opportunity to demonstrate what you have learned in class.  You should keep in mind the role of models in science when designing and testing your model.  Your work is to be done individually, however we are willing to hear arguments that, in individual cases, the modeling should be done in teams of two.  

<p>Although we won't be starting this project formally until the middle of the term we would like you to start looking for inspiration early.  Have you come across any interesting unanswered problems in your studies?  Is there a poorly understood phenomenon you'd like to try and explain?  Start thinking now!

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Task')); ?>

<p>Find a current problem in science, or an old problem which has not been modeled using current modeling approaches. Construct an original model which simulates some aspect(s) of the phenomenon being modeled. Acquire data and use these data to determine if your model conforms in behaviour to that of the phenomenon in some essential way.  If it is necessary to perform your modeling work in a laboratory, it is your responsibility to locate the laboratory (presumably at UBC) in which the work might be done. We will approach laboratory directors to make arrangements for space and equipment needs.

<p>This project may be done in conjunction with a directed studies project, honours thesis or co-op work, but the two must be sufficiently distinct that credit is clearly not being given twice for the same work.  To ensure that this does not happen, we will require that the two reports be submitted to both courses.</p>


<? tochead(array('name'=>'Stages')); ?>

<p>This project represents a substantial part of the course and your final marks.  To keep you on track the project will be broken down into a number of stages:

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Inspiration', 'level'=>3)); ?>

<p>Think of a topic you'd like to research.  Think of an interesting and unsolved problem in any area of science you like.  Handwrite a one-page synopsis introducing us to the phenomenon and the mystery.  Explain clearly what is not known about the phenomenon.  Conclude by reiterating clearly: what is your research question?

<p>Hint: Haven't got a clue?  Visit Science Magazine's 125th Anniversary Special Issue at <?=url(array('link'=>'http://www.sciencemag.org/sciext/125th/'));?> for some great ideas!

<p>(We recognize and accept that your question may change as a result of further research.  The goal at this stage is to get you thinking about a topic.)

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Literature search', 'level'=>3)); ?>

<p>Find two scientific research articles that address your topic of interest.  Explain, in two or three pages (double spaced, large font) how they relate to your research question.  If they fail to answer your question explain how.  If the papers do answer your question, what questions do they themselves raise?  Explain.  Conclude by forming a new research question.

<p>Attach copies of your primary cited literature to your submitted work.

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Proposal', 'level'=>3)); ?>

<p>Explain the phenomenon you intend to model, and the basic structure of the model you are going to develop.  State the assumptions you intend to make and justify them.  List the challenges/difficulties you expect to encounter and explain how you intend to overcome them.  Construct a timeline of personal goals for the project.  See the <a href="#Proposal&nbsp;Template">Proposal Template</a> for page limits and formatting requirements.

<p>The proposal must include a preliminary list of references.

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Proposal Template', 'level'=>4, 'notoc'=>true)); ?>

<p>A Microsoft Word template is available from <?=url(array('link'=>'http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~rikblok/isci422/templates/project3stage3-proposal.doc'));?>.  Wherever possible the style in the template should be followed.  If you are unable to view the template let us know and we will provide it in another format.  The template also includes a grading rubric of the criteria that will be used to evaluate your work.

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Prototype', 'level'=>3)); ?>

You will be asked to demonstrate a rough mock-up of your model at the <?=prettydue('Project 3: Prototype');?>.  At this point the model need not be sufficiently developed to answer your research question, but it should be far enough along that it can reproduce the phenomenon under investigation in some essential way.

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Demonstration', 'level'=>3)); ?>

At the <?=prettydue('Project 3: Demonstration');?> you will be required to demonstrate your final model.  You must be able to show how the model generates data that addresses your original research question and answer questions about its inner workings.  

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Poster', 'level'=>3)); ?>

<p>The poster should be a visually attractive presentation of your model on a single sheet of poster size (2<?=$times?>3 or 3<?=$times?>4 feet) card.  It should illustrate your motivation, model, and important conclusions in an uncomplicated manner.  For examples of layout and style visit the ISP computer lab at LSK 303E.  Your poster will be evaluated for clarity and content by the instructors and your peers.

<p>You are welcome to invite guests to the poster session on <?=prettydue('Project 3: Poster')?>.

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Report', 'level'=>3)); ?>

<p>Write a report (see the <a href="#Report&nbsp;Template">Report Template</a> for page limits and formatting requirements; may be longer but only after approval) including an abstract, figures, tables, and references.  The report should contain:</p>

<ol><li>A fully referenced description of the phenomenon being modeled,
	<li>A fully referenced description of the model, and an analysis of its nature,
	<li>A detailed statement of all assumptions implicit or explicit in the model,
	<li>A description of techniques used to demonstrate that the model conforms in some essential way to the behaviour of the phenomenon being modeled, and
	<li>A summary of the insights into the phenomenon that are made possible by the model.
</ol>

<p>Computer source code (if applicable) may be appended beyond the page restriction but the code <b>must</b> also be emailed to <?=mailto(array('name'=>$email));?> before the deadline.</p>

<? tochead(array('name'=>'Report Template', 'level'=>4, 'notoc'=>true)); ?>

<p>A Microsoft Word template is available from <?=url(array('link'=>'http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~rikblok/isci422/templates/project3stage7-report.doc'));?>.  Wherever possible the style in the template should be followed.  If you are unable to view the template let us know and we will provide it in another format.  The template also includes a grading rubric of the criteria that will be used to evaluate your work.
